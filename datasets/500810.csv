"Basically Fallout (original) in a fantasy, steampunk setting. There are even two particular regions which pay homage to Fallout with a ""junktown"" in one and two-headed cattle in the other.

You can play as human, dwarf, gnome, elf, halfling, half-elf, half-orc, or half-ogre.

You can build up your character with melee, ranged (bows, crossbows, thrown), steamworks (firearms, clockwork weapons), and arcana. Arcana and steamworks work against each other; if you put skills in one, it makes the other less effective.

Character stats make a huge difference in available dialogue options (create a low intelligence character for an especially interesting playthrough).

The game is pretty big, so expect it to take a long time to finish.",1,1,0,0,0,2025-11-08,2025-11-08,0,30,21,5

"Arcanum is a brilliant RPG, and one that I would argue is in contender for the best in it's genre. What it lacks in some mechanics and controls features (which is mostly a testament to its age) it makes up for with the most compelling open world setting I think I've played in a game.

The controls and general gameplay mechanics feel weird at first, but are quite intuitive once you've actually learnt them. Its biggest flaw is that most things are explained in the manual, meaning you sort of learn the controls as you go along, discovering features like how to use the quick bar or deploy a mechanical spider on the fly. Once you're past that difficulty spike, the mechanics of the game are quite fleshed out. The schematic system is extensive, the items and craftables feel near limitless. Overall its a very mechanically dense game.

The worlds story feels wasted on the game its found itself in, and im honestly amazed its never been adapted into a show or sequels after it released. Its concept is such unique ground to set a DND world in that most interactions and story beats are so unpredictable compared to your average RPG. The characters are all very fleshed out, the world and its environments are incredibly complex, and overall the way that NPCs and books talk about the world builds such a vivid picture compared to others in the genre.

The combat leaves much to be desired. Where i think they fucked up was in making the spells and high-end weapons too easy to aquire and too powerful. This means that many monsters lategame will kill a party member in 2-3 hits before you can even prevent it. I would much rather feel less overpowered and have less spiky combats than the state its in now, especially given the setting. The combat options intensify this, the turn based combat is pretty good but the initiative still feels random and causes you to suffer the same issues but slower. The real time on the other hand is a complete gamble of chaos mostly determined by how you're characters do damage. For example, playing as a summoner I could easily agro enemies, and have my monsters kill them before they even change attacker. This meant my strategy was to pull enemies, then run until they die. This is stopped when the enemy has a bow, in which I die to 10 arrows before I can even enter turn based mode.

The appeal of this game is mostly in the story and the world. And as someone who didn't play 90s RPGs I can safely say the graphics do not pull you away from that feeling. Its still just as interesting to explore as the day it released, and I can honestly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of narrative games. You can hate the combat, the gameplay, the leveling system and most mechanics with it and still come out of this game feeling like you enjoyed it more than you didn't just off the strength of the world. The world really is just that good and its why someone like me is even recommended it in the first place.",1,1,0,0,0,2025-11-06,2025-11-06,129,43,3065,2453

"играл на пиратке, единственный минус по моему мнению - убогое управление, УЖАСНО УБОГОЕ УПРАВЛЕНИЕ в остальном норм рпг которая окунает тебя в стим панк (за женщину пол игры проходится через постель + за реализм)",1,1,0,0,0,2025-10-03,2025-10-03,22,16,6,6
"Сразу скажу, что версия из стима - кусок дерьма и работает кое-как, если заработает у вас вообще. 2 раза я терял сейвы на середине игры, потому что из-за чего-то игра просто переставала запускаться, а перенесенные на переустановленную версию игры сейвы тупо не отображались. Сколько я ни пытался накатывать патчи и сборки на эту версию, работать нормально она отказывалась. Поэтому берите версию из гога и не ебите себе мозги этим калом.

Да, один раз я захотел поиграть в постал 3 и после этого потерял сейв. Может тут я был не прав, но почему это вообще убило игру я так и не понял.

Что по самой игре - это одна из лучших РПГ, в которые я играл. Тонны диалогов, вариативности в квестах, самих квестов. Куча разных билдов и комбинаций навыков со статами. Если нравится экспериментировать, то в этом плане у игры просто огромная реиграбельность. 

Хочешь быть магом? Тут для тебя 16 школ, выбирай и комбинируй что хочешь. Боевым магом - тоже пожалуйста, те же 16 школ + можешь нацепить на себя зачарованные доспехи и оружие и разваливать на ручную. Лучником-технологом? Технологом-милишником? Тонны рецептов и дисциплин  для крафта на месте. Опять же, выбирай что нравится, комбинируй, собирай имбу на свой вкус.

Если больше интересует развитие пачки напарников, то тут есть и харизма, которая дико зарешает в диалогах и позволит набрать целую армию, которая убьет всех за вас. Проблема тут только в конфликте интересов с некоторыми напарниками. Например сраный дворф меня в какой-то момент просто доебал тем, что мы мол атакуем таких достойных людей, когда сраные темные эльфы окружили нас и ебашили со всех сторон. В итоге он вообще вписался за них и его пришлось убить. Та же самая херня произошла с эльфийкой, когда в случайной встрече на нас напали очередные медведи и ее очень разозлило, что я ставил рекорд по количеству ударов по ним ножом. Так что да, напарников лучше выбирать с умом и оставлять их где-нибудь, если собираетесь сделать что-то, что им не нравится.

"Musím se přiznat, že mě svět Arkána vysloveně okouzlil. Když to porovnám s Baldurs Gate 1, tak mi příběh přišel mnohem barvitější a zajímavější, dokonce i s několika zvraty.  U BG mi hra připadala jako série her Dračího Doupěte, což není snad ani špatně, ale k člověku doléhá jakási ozvěna béčkového fantasy, kde je svět připravený pro dobroduhy a pod každým kamenem je prastarý elfský artefakt, nebo pradávná stvůra. To ale může být dojem, který mám o celém světě Dungeons and Dragons. 

Arkánum působí mnohem dospělejším dojmem, s propracovaným světem, kde zápasí technologie s magií. Je to svět plný sporných rozhodnutí, rasových problémů a zajímavé historie. Arkánum působí celistvě. Každé město se v něčem liší a má vztah s místem jiným, svými činy můžete měnit celé politické uspořádání jednotlivých měst a království. Je toho dost a dost. Potěšily mě i hádanky, které člověka nevodí za ručičku a musí si sám zjistit různé informace. Záleží za koho hrajete, když budete člověk, tak se k vám lidé budou chovat normálně, když ale budete hrát za poloorka, tak vás budou nesnášet. 

Všechno ale nejsou jen klady. Člověk se musí dnes docela nutit, aby ho začala hra bavit, za to může i na rok 2001 slabší grafika a nedodělaná hratelnost. Hra působí v některých místech nevyváženě(kdy mohu vymlátit celé trpasličí podzemí plné potvor bez velkých obtíží, ale partička orčích chuligánů na předměstí Tarantu mi pořádně vypráší kožich), a to i přesto, že jsem hru hrál s UAP patchem, který spravuje hromadu bugů, snaží se hru vyvážit a zvyšuje rozlišení. 

Kdyby Troika měla víc peněz a času, tak by mohl z této hry vzejít nový Fallout a uchvátit hráče svým světem. Bohužel žádný další díl nevyšel a po Bloodlines Troika zkrachovala. Nemusela skončit na smetišti dějin, kdy si ji jednou za čas zahrají milovníci starých RPG. Škoda, že ani Tim Cain, ani nikdo z Troiky tu značku nevlastní, takže se ani Obsidian nemůže o nic pokusit.",1,1,0,0,0,2025-09-15,2025-09-16,0,11,3446,3416

"I played with UAP, only enabling the patches, not the mods or additions. I'm going to make myself very clear: do not play this dogshit meme of a game. It is an idea for an unrealized game, not a game in it's own right. It is a cool idea, I admit, and I would welcome a competent developer, one who have completed a game this century, like Whalenought or ATOM, taking a stab at realizing a true Arcanum, but I will not blow smoke up your ass. Playing this game will prove whether you are a Man, or a witless cultist.

The game released in beta, I'm well aware. Its nigh a quarter century old, but unlike Planescape, IWD, Fallout, Baldur's Gate, this isn't a game worth finishing. It isn't difficult, in fact if you want a difficult game, make yourself ugly and don't save the dog. However, it is unfathomably tedious. My second character, the default dwarf, has aged five years simply walking to his objectives. Where's the pacing? Developers who can't control themselves need a main quest timer, as in Fallout, or they will scatter the story all over the board and dilute it with nonsense errands and fluff better left to another game. Its insane that civilized locations aren't depicted on the map, in a setting with choo choo trains and dirigibles. Come on! If you want me to stay on course, so I don't over-level and destroy ""the balance"" - a theme in this game - then write a worthy story. Send me to interesting locations.

Locations are important, but not as important as characters. Arcanum's got quite the cast of characters, so you'd think a game praised for reactivity and choices and consequences, good writing and such, would have outstanding companions. Yes, the dog. The dog is so good at killing your enemies, that you will form an emotional bond with it. Its howls are somber, you can only imagine what its been through. Who was its real previous owner? An ill-fated mariner? A kind old lady? An orphan sacrificed in secret to the god of the gnomes? Now consider Virgil, ""Is that you, GOD?"" we all love the time he said ""err, I, ummm... Joachim will know."" and who could forget ""Sorry, but I walk a lonely road now. Don't you dare follow me!"" YOU were following ME! Kick rocks, ya Green Day song about teenage angst. You bet I left him for dead. Mechanically, companions needed scripts in real time mode, or the player should have been given control of the party in tb mode, because of course they're retards. You're better off crafting or summoning followers than keeping companions, though you will need to keep one to resurrect you.

Arcanum is a character sheet in a dumb as rocks RPG system. The level cap is 50 - UH OH! You know what that means? It means that the system is 100% slop. When you level, you spend 1 character point, or every five levels 2, on raising abilities... or your skills... or your hp/vitality... or toward your tech degree... OR YOUR MAGIC DEGREES! WTF is this!? Just blend it all together, why don't you! You can spend character points directly on vitality and hp? The same character points are spent on both abilities and skills? XDD

I've got a time machine, come on, let's go ask Troika what the fuck they were even thinking. Us: Hello, is this cult classic Troika? Troika: Yes.
Us: What were you thinking?
Troika: Well, uh, we're making a very epic game. Yes, Arcanum is so epic. I hear its the most epic. People tell me all the time how epic Arcanum is. That means we need a high level cap.
Us: Is the game epic? Is there an epic quest in this game, or is it loaded with trash encounters and ""reactivity"" shit tests for buildfags obsessed with playing RPGs from a character sheet?!

Look, I hate this stupid cult classic crap, but I'm a stubborn retard. Its always gnawed at me that I quit my first time in Tarant, every time I tried to play. ""Maybe I'm not being fair."" I thought. ""Maybe this cultish slobbering over the game is justified."" No, it isn't justified. Don't play it. If you must play Arcanum, and you don't want to buildfag, make a Charismatic Harm Mage. Your choice of good or evil. Get the dog. Look up the quest to become God, do the Siamese Twins quest, and try to have fun.",0,1,0,1,2,2025-08-22,2025-08-22,0,6,4748,4740

"Utterly massive and versatile. Any build or playstyle is viable if you play it right, and the game will accommodate it. Despite some dated elements (for instance, items that should be stackable like potions take up their own inventory slots) , the game holds up very well and in many ways excels where so many modern RPGs fail. The world feels alive and vibrant, and your efforts actually feel like they have weight and purpose. Random little sidequests you do can have massive implications on future quests and the ending you get. The dialogue is superbly written, every character feels alive. I felt like talking to everyone I saw just in case I got some interesting unique dialogue. There are some characters who serve no purpose to the overall plot but whose stories are deeply moving. And the world is sprawling and intricate, and most of all fun. Arcanum is chaotic, but there's too much order these days anyway.

En otras ocasiones es sencillamente porque miro a la estantería de mi despacho y veo la caja del juego. Algunas veces, sencillamente aparece en mi cabeza, por arte de magia. Y siempre sonrío. Es uno de esos RPGs especiales, de los que te hacen mirar con orgullo tanto al género como al propio medio. En Arcanum, puedes ver los créditos tras pasar más de 50 horas con un personaje, empezar una nueva partida con otro protagonista distinto, y darte cuenta de que posiblemente no has visto ni una quinta parte del juego. Es de esos. 

También es cierto que tiene una importante barrera de entrada. El combate, en general, es un despelote que resulta mejor evitar en la medida de lo posible. Los gráficos y la resolución entiendo que pueden ser un problema. Y, aunque en 2001 ya se estaba empezando a dejar atrás la dependencia del manual de instrucciones para poder jugar a un videojuego, en Arcanum es muy importante meterle una leída a sus casi 200 páginas de manual.

"This game gave me one of the greatest gaming memories of my childhood. I never actually finished it myself, but i watched my dad complete it multiple times. That didn’t matter to me - I got so much enjoyment simply from exploring and LIVING in its world. I remember being on a family vacation and, instead of enjoying it, i was DAYDREAMING about all the things i’d do in Arcanum once I got back home. And don’t even get me started on what i truly believe is one of the GREATEST gaming soundtracks ever composed. It adds so much to the atmosphere and immersion of the world.

I’m not sure how easy it would be to get into this game nowadays, especially if you don’t have the nostalgia for it. But if you’ve enjoyed any classic CRPGs from that era and haven’t tried Arcanum, you definitely should. It’s a hidden gem -overshadowed by more popular titles like Fallout or Baldur’s Gate, but no less important because of that.

Also, it runs great on the Steam Deck. It just requires a bit of tinkering at first, but after that, it’s smooth sailing.

P.S. The fact that you can just exit the borders of one location and seamlessly (albeit slowly) travel into another without using map travel is as insane today as it was back then.

They were among the greatest studios to ever exist, and though their works were not without flaws, bugs, or clunkiness, they were all exceptional in their own way, brimming with character and a real soul, that is missing from the vast majority of games made nowdays.

Арканум - це культова гра, яка в деяких аспектах випередила свій час, але яка, нажаль, так і не отримала достойного продовження чи ремастеру. Безумовно, сьогодні вона вже відчувається дещо застарілою, але все ще може приємно дивувати своїм сюжетом, квестами, варіативністю прокачки персонажа.

Такий сюжет, як в Арканумі, сьогодні мало де можна зустріти. Історію цієї гри придумували не для тих геймерів, які очікують від гри лише інтуїтивного безмежного драйву і на яких зараз орієнтується геймдев. У часи розробки Аркануму рольові ігри брали не кінематографічною постановкою діалогів, але були вправою для допитливого мозку, вимагали живої уяви та вдумливості. Сюжет цієї гри - це, фактично, детектив, у якому вам постійно треба розслідувати, йти від однієї загадки до іншої, дивуватись твістам, цікавим та неочевидним поворотам.

Саме головне, що гра чудово вписує в цю детективну історію важливі та дорослі запитання. Чи збуваються пророцтва? Чи існує свобода волі? Чи пророцтво є заздалегідь визначеним рухом, що був передбачений тисячі років тому, чи це є лише набір випадковостей та результат вільно прийнятих рішень? З перших хвилин гра скаже гравцеві, що він обраний, є реінкарнацією древнього героя та має визначити долю світу гри. На нього полюють могутні темні організації, оскільки лише він становить для них справжню загрозу. Але чи правда головний герой обраний? Можливо він просто ніхто, який опинився не в той час і не в тому місці.

Побічні квести тут також достойні. Ніхто не боїться викликати у гравця негативні емоції поганим завершенням квестового ланцюжка. Інколи гравець стикається з суворою правдою світу Аркануму. Деякі історіє закінчуються добре, а деякі викликають сум, або, навіть, вражають цинізмом та жорстокістю. Тут немає штучної толерантності, тут всі рівні, тут принижують та гноблять всіх однаково. Ельфів принижують гноми, гномів ельфи, карликів люди, карлики маніпулюють всіма іншими. Якщо ти маєш низький інтелект і погано будуєш фрази - тобі постійно про це будуть нагадувати. Якщо граєте за жінку, то зможете маніпулювати чоловіками, але і будете страждати від залицянь. Технологів принижують маги, а технологи зверхньо ставляться до магів. Всі раси, статі та класи тут страждають. Найлегше, напевно, людині, але вона все одно сама нещасна, оскільки її вік самий короткий.

У грі великий відкритий світ. Так, тут повно умовностей. Легендарна занедбана столиця Дернхольм тут може виглядати як десяток хат в багнюці, а загублене в хащах лісу місто ельфів фактично буде нагадувати підлітковий мотузковий парк. Ці всі особливості не варто сильно критикувати, але сприймати з розумінням та не звертати на них особливої уваги. При цьому відкритий світ загальної великої локації ігрового світу реально без ""швів"", від одної локи до іншої теоретично можна перебігти навіть не користуючись швидким переміщенням і відбиті на голову гравці можуть спробувати це зробити.

Загалом геймплей у грі вже дещо застарілий. Але тут вистачає механік, які прекрасно працюють і дотепер. Досить непогано реалізований крафт. Дуже цікаво бігати та збирати схеми, метріали, створювати винаходи. Тут також купа шкіл магії та повно цікавих спелів. Навіть звичайні скіли, такі як володіння зброєю чи переконання, крім традиційної прокачки скілпоінтами, мають три мастері рівня з бонусами, які дають вчителі та останній з яких супроводжується квестом.

У грі взагалі супер гнучка прокачка, можна створювати купу умовних класів в залежності від обраної комбінації скілів: технолог-воїн в механічний броні, маг-вбивця, некромант-барига, технолог-стрілок, слабак-технік з купою роботів, хитрий ділок з бригадою найманців, магічний лучник, паладін, метатель ножів тощо. Комбінацій купа. Не можна змішувати лише магію та технологію, тому техно-мага зробити не вийде. Але це визначено ігровим лором.

Що по мінусах?
1. Дизбаланс. На високих рівнях будете анігілювати все живе.
2. Зміна рівня складності ріже експу. Тобто якщо складність висока, то крім штрафу до демеджу ще отримуєте на 25% експи менше. Навіщо це було зроблено? Типу будеш недокачаний і тому буде складніше? Не найкраще рішення. Благо складність можна змінювати в будь-який момент.
3. Інвентар. Вічно не вистачає місця. Рятують тільки ""кармани"" напарників та те що можна скидати шмот в сундуках (наприклад на складах Таранту) і він не зникає.
4. Є деякі досить неочевидні та марудні квести (наприклад квест з підсвіткою рун в Туллі).

Патчі. Гра місцями з багами і тому потребує неофіційного патчу ""Unofficial Arcanum Patch"", який наче розроблявся українцем. Тому це наш вибір.

Загалом, поціновувачам рольових ігор (комп'ютерних) та тим з них, кого не відлякує дещо застарілий геймлей, Арканум варто спробувати і сьогодні.",1,1,0,6,1,2025-04-22,2025-04-22,0,88,243,243

"Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura – A Flawed Masterpiece

A unique blend of steampunk and magic, Arcanum offers one of the most ambitious RPG experiences ever. With deep world-building, reactive storytelling, and an incredibly flexible character system, it’s a dream come true for hardcore CRPG fans. Dialogue and quest design allow for unparalleled freedom—whether you outsmart enemies, use brute force, or literally talk to the dead.

However, technical issues hold it back. Even for its time, the graphics and animations were outdated, and without fan patches, the game is nearly unplayable due to bugs. The combat system is clunky, and exploration can feel tedious without fast travel.

Would I recommend it to modern players? Only to those willing to embrace its flaws. Despite its rough edges, Arcanum remains a cult classic and one of the most ambitious RPGs ever made. If there’s any justice, Microsoft will someday give it the remake it deserves.",1,1,0,2,0,2025-02-17,2025-02-17,244,16,6577,3881

"Please ignore my steam playtime. 
This is...my favorite game of all time. I played it the most, with replays that couldn't be counted on both hands...from the begging till end, I played this, over and over again..and always with someone new, with a background, path, a different way to solve quests that would fit them...I once played a slight bad guy who kept going back to the punishing prostitute in the main city after each bad deed...i had a drunk character bed a sheep...an evil, proud, dark elf who'd obliterate anyone with her magic, just for looking at her wrong on the wrong leg day...an idiot savant was also fun. So was being sent to charm school or starting as a soon to be penniless orphan..and oh the music, the steampunk setting..there is NO game quite like Arcanum. Some that come close are the old fallout games which are gems of their own but...Arcanum, now, always, first in my heart, game wise. 

Wish Troika was still kicking...but if it was, would it still stick to their magnificent roots? We'll never know.
-----
An attempt to be less bias: It's not perfect. I have to use either the unofficial patch or download the multiverse edition for the bug fixes. The ending is not so satisfying compared to the rest of the masterpiece. 

There's atmospheric violin music throughout the game, among which you might find some best soundtracks you've heard in a game or otherwise, depending on taste.

Some might find the artstyle out of date but i'm 100% honest when I say it's my favourite. It fits the theme, isn't goofy, is beautiful in a unique way.

The replay value, as I mentioned, is HUGE. Lots of ways to solve the same quests, an alignment system, background, races and reactions to your race, beauty, intelligence etc.

The world itself is also large, brimming with people and quests.

The story is, in a lot of ways, what you make it. Same as with your character.

"One of the best RPG's of it's early isometric era, Arcanum feels like it's often overlooked during a time when online gaming was starting to take over, and the major focus was on console modernization.
For it's time, Arcanum had a lot to offer. 

Pro's
-Well written dialogue accompanied by stellar voice acting. 
-Fulfilling map travel stuffed with secrets and lore.
-Excellent soundtrack, to this day it still gives me a heavy dose of nostalgia
-Solid Character build diversity directly effecting NPC dialogue and, to a lesser extent, questing and storyline.
-Gritty, dark,  steampunk and magic landscapes that only the early 2000's managed to pull off with it's art models.
-Replayability. Each different character style opens up different interactions, solutions, and rewards.

Con's
-Dated content, a 200 hour single player campaign, this is not.
-Early 2000's graphics, no remaster here.
-Glitches, there will be. Some of which are exploitive. This can benefit you, if you're into that kind of thing.
-Compatibility issues, some assembly may be required.

If you don't mind the feel of the early 2000's vibe this is sure to give you, I put this up there neatly beside Baldurs Gate, and Fallout 1-2.",1,1,0,6,0,2025-01-16,2025-01-16,0,19,5424,5424

"A heavily flawed masterpiece, this highly experimental CRPG set in a fantasy world undergoing an industrial revolution fortunately hits more often than it misses. Arcanum has one of the most exotic and well-crafted settings in any CRPG, and is accompanied with a fantastic story rich in adventure and philosophy. It also has one of the best levelling up systems in any video game ever, as the 16 spells colleges, 8 technological trees, and 16 regular skills facilitate a near limitless number of different builds/roleplays. However, there are major problems. The combat is borderline unplayable, and pretty much everyone uses exploits/cheese strategies to get past the fighting. Much of the loot is also terrible (see also: Hexed Items), which seriously hurts exploration, and the inventory management is just abominable, especially if you have companions. While I think the story is excellent overall, at least half of it is spent searching for the Black Mountain Clan (BMC) and hitting constant dead ends. You will also need to install mods (UAP in my case) and you will likely have to consult the wiki every 5 minutes. Overall still a fantastic game, but one that I can only recommend to serious CRPG enthusiasts.",1,1,0,17,0,2025-01-03,2025-01-03,0,23,4339,4339

"Arcanum Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, the real Fallout 3. This extraordinary game was created by many of the same devs who created Fallout and worked at Interplay. Set in a world that was once ruled by magick, that was run and controlled by magick, is now being opposed and replaced by technology and industrialization. Technology and Magick are polar opposites in this world, so greatly so, that people that become greatly attuned to one, become entirely separated and even allergic to the other. This creates a major rift in society on Arcanum with some cities being ruled by technology, others by Magick. This also has a major effect on the player and in the gameplay mechanics as well. For if you are too Technology attuned, then spells will not affect you, neither can you cast them yourself. You even can not enter a Magick equipment selling shop, as the shop keeper will yell at you to get out, because your Technology attunement is interfering with their magickal equipment. The opposite of all of this is true for a Magickally attuned character when interacting with Technology as well of course. 
This also adds an extra layer to the character creation process, by having to decide if you want to be highly Magick aligned, Technology aligned, or stay in the middle. This attunement will change over the course of the game depending on your choices on your character sheet. If you want to learn a new spell, that will shift you toward Magick, you want to learn a new skill like crafting or lockpicking, that will shift you toward technology. While you can stay in the middle and use both types of attunement, it is advised to stick with one, because the power of your skills in either Technology or Magick, scales with your level of aptitude. So if you have low Magick, your spells won't be as effective, for example.
The world building and lore of Arcanum is also outstanding and very fun to read. Unlike some games, you aren’t given lore dumps or massive walls of text from NPCs unless you specifically ask about it, and even then I found it incredibly rare. Most of the worldbuilding is told to you organically as you talk to people and complete quests. You'll get involved with political struggles, and talk to rulers and kings, hear gossip and rumors on the streets. You can see the varying architecture from each city and location. This will all convey the background and lore to you in an interesting way that feels natural and doesn’t bog down the pacing. There are also plenty of books, altars, and other literature to read that give you much more in depth writings on the history of Arcanum that you can read if you are interested. The story as well, while a little tropey, is really good because of all the interesting characters you meet, and locations you’ll go to, and just the way you interact with the story based on the character you build, and the choices you make. I don’t want to go into spoilers, but I found it very enjoyable and much better than some other RPGs like Pillars of Eternity 2, or Fallout 2.

The game however, is not all perfect. Arcanum released in a very buggy state so you will probably have to install the unofficial patch which will fix most of the bugs. I played with the unofficial patch and didn’t run into any bugs personally. Then there is the combat. It is split between two different modes, real-time and turn-based, that you can switch between when you want with the space bar. It is best to stay in turn-based mode most of the time however, because the combat can get very fast and chaotic. It is clear that the game was designed around turn-based, and real-time was added after because the balance becomes broken in real-time mode. For example if you play as a mage, you can cast spells as fast as you can click the mouse button with no cool down or anything to stop you other than your fatigue which really trivializes combat encounters. I do appreciate being able to switch between the two modes, however, because there can be a lot of trash mob fights such as when you're traveling the world map or just in general, so being able to switch over to real-time and quickly clear out the enemies is nice. A better solution however, would be to only have turn-based combat, and add an option to speed up the animations so each turn goes by quicker. That way you don’t break the balancing of the game and can also speed through fights. The combat itself however, even in turn based mode is not as fun as it could be. For perspective, I played as a mage type character. So I only used spells in combat and had a party of 5 companions with me, 6 by the end, to keep the enemies away from me and to dish out most of the damage. The combat as a mage, really just boiled down to casting the harm spell over and over because the damage it does scales up really high with your magickal aptitude and remains powerful all the way to the end of the game. There are a lot of other utility and buffing spells to use as well but aside from the occasional healing spell, I didn’t have to do anything else in combat really. I played on the moderate difficulty setting and found that after a certain point, when my companions had decent gear and my magickal aptitude reached about the halfway point, the game really wasn't a challenge anymore. The only thing stopping my mage from ultimate destruction was my fatigue, which despite it reaching around 160 by the end, still managed to drain fast in combat. Fatigue is one of the most important resources in combat. Fatigue is used to cast spells, attack enemies, and is sometimes drained when enemies hit you. If your fatigue reaches zero or below, then you pass out. It is an interesting mechanic and I wouldn’t mind it, however the one annoyance I have is the only way to regain fatigue is to either use a consumable, rest, or stand there and wait for it to slowly refill. So if your in the middle of a long dungeon, and you run out of fatigue, and you don’t have any consumables, then you either stand there and wait for like 5 mins or you trek all the way back out of the dungeon so you can rest, then make your way all the way back to where you left off in the dungeon, to continue on. It does get a little annoying, however if you are playing as a Technology attuned character that can craft fatigue refilling consumables then you probably won’t run into this problem. As a mage character however, it happens frequently.
Despite these problems, Arcanum is still an outstanding game and one of the best RPGs. The level of depth that the character creation has and the choices that you can make that will dramatically affect your playthrough is matched by almost no other, except for Troika’s Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines. The world of Arcanum they made is so fascinating and there is so much more to explore, it's a shame there will never be an Arcanum 2. Still this game is an amazing experience that feels like a proper continuation to Fallout in gameplay systems, progression, choice, and rich world building.",1,1,0,8,0,2025-01-01,2025-01-01,725,42,3488,3488

"Okay so this is a game that I remember one of my friends going on about back in the 2000's, but I never got around to playing it.

Bought it on Steam in 2020 for pence but never got around to playing it.

Saw a random Youtube video praising the socks off it and thought ""ah screw it, aint played a CRPG for a long ass time, lets gooo!""

Game is jank, but with the community patch (UAP in my case) it works wonderfully at 1920x1080 res (though needed a new DDwrapper or whatever the file was called, Google it if you get stuttering).

I like summoner classes, and this game is very generous when it comes to conjuring monsters. In fact, I got so powerful, when I stumbled across a really messed up quest involving tiny people and breeding farms, I was able to lay low the capital city with just my legion of undead and hell spawn. None were spared, it was not a good ending but it was better than letting the tiny people get away with it.

You can really out level the game quickly if you do a lot of fighting on the world map, so watch out for that, because I was pretty much OP from level 1 and never really ran into a challenge. I'd only die if the a.i of my spawned monsters would fail (sometimes they teleport to you and go docile mid-fight for absoloutely no reason, allowing the bad guys to stab a pitch fork in your necormancer face).

Story is so-so, I guess I liked it more than BG1, but I think the game shows its age most of all in this area. So much exposition and red herrings, but its not awful and there were moments where I was genuinely engaged.

However the meat of the fun for me was just exploring and doing random side quests, really immersing myself in the world of Arcanum. Its a shame the game doesn't really favour this style of play, with areas being locked behind main quest progression, but its fine.

Oh also it kinda plays like Fallout 1 and 2, especially world map travel, leading me to wonder if there were some fallout devs involved but I haven't looked into it.

Took me about 30ish hours to complete, had to use a guide at times because this game doesn't hold your hand and often expects you to grid-search a town to track down a single individual, and you have to speak to people first to reveal their names - this gets very tiring. Someone for example asks you to speak to an archer, but there are 10 archer guards in the town, so its just - yeah this is where the game shows its age and jank.

Would recommend at full price, overall I think its fun, the world is unique, the game is quite easy but there is some challenge and to be fair I think the summoner class might just be op as all hell. If you like CRPGs and have played Fallout 1/2 or Baldurs Gate 1/2, you'll probably like this.",1,1,0,14,0,2024-12-21,2024-12-21,0,15,3321,2811
"This is a first entry in what feels like what was meant to be a multi-entry series. It is at its core just a story about an unknowing Chosen One who must save the continent from an evil deity while helping (or hindering) folks around the lands. That is a barebones description of this game and it does it no justice to describe it solely as that. 

This is a game about steampunk vs magic and an evolving landscape where the two are diametrically opposed. There are fantasy races with their idiosyncrasies and stereotypes but it doesn't detract from the experience. The magic system is what you'd expect from a first-entry: underbaked but exciting to use. The melee/firearms system is the same. There are numerous companions scattered about. Navigation is what you would see in similar CRPGs from this era, which means it's a little dated. 

However, this is one of my favorite games of all time. It's worth investing time into and getting lost in the lore. All of the shortcomings of this game are the shortcomings of a first entry in a series, meaning they'd be ironed out or tuned or refined in some way. This game never had the luck to get a second entry, unfortunately. It still shines bright, though. 

I give it a solid 8/10. If I could have a sequel to any game in history, I'd want this. It deserves a chance to grow and maybe even flourish.",1,1,0,1,0,2024-12-20,2024-12-20,169,5,1286,1286

"I massively admire many of the things this game does. It's truly reactive in your character choices & dialogue, it has tons of potential build variety, the story & setting both seem really interesting and it's overall pretty unique. But personally I just cannot get past how un-fun the minute-to-minute gameplay is.

The combat is really simple and unenjoyable even compared to other RPGs of the time. I think the most fun one would get here is from breaking it or trying the weird options available but things like that don't appeal to me, I want the core combat to actually feel good to engage with. You can play it turn-based or real-time and neither feel good to me. There's so much running around, and even simple things like the way the camera pans around feel janky and annoying, like you can barely move your camera away from where your character is. I persisted for a good few hours getting through several quests and exploring different locations, only to realise I hadn't really enjoyed any of it except for the dialogue/build choice reactivity, so I guess I can't recommend this game even though I highly admire some of the things it does.",0,0,0,6,1,2024-10-21,2025-06-18,0,124,307,307

"One of the greatest games I've ever played. Just obscure enough to not feel mainstream, and that's always a plus for me.

The world of this game is fantastic. The play between magic and technology, and depth of the characters, and the range of options and what becomes accessible or not based on character design makes for potent replay value.

I grew so much through this world of Arcanum and learning from the Dwarves and Elves. The perspectives aren't just fantasty - it applies to our real world. And this was one of the first games I ever played where that bridge was connected.

King Loghaire, that wisdom of perspective you shared about humans and technology changed me forever.

I played this game before it was on Steam. Drog Blacktooth did so much work to patch it and unlock content that was trapped behind bugs and an unfinished project that the game was for its budget and timeline being cut short.

A beautiful game that still encourages the use of our imaginations for the low resolution of the graphics within it.

And the MUSIC!!!! That violin, oh, this is my all-time favorite game world. I hope we see more of it someday. If there were one VR immersive world I'd like to experience, I'd vote for this one.

I don't care for seeing the Madame's Brothel as the primary picture representing this game on the Steam store - though I appreciate the humor in it, it detracts from the AMAZING storyline and profound depth that this game contains.

A beautiful beautiful game that I will forever be grateful to have experienced.

The unofficial patch is apparently a must (haven't tried it without) but is easy to download and there is a guide on steam. If you like Tides of Numera, Torment, Baldur's Gate 1+2 (clearly superior to 3) and like quests with a variety of solutions many of them not obvious or things you'd not expect to work for a game over 20 years old then I highly recommend. The combat is much much easier on turn-based but it's also not really why you should play the game. Save often because autosave is not a thing and the early game is arguably harder. The quests are really inventive, a surprising number of starting races and backgrounds but you can also easily pivot into other builds. I found the whole tech v magick lore interesting and every town was a new adventure. Oh and I think Steam didn't record my hours on this game correctly, I got at least 60 hours out of it.

What is Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magic Obscura? A classic, that's what.
Made in a different time, perhaps not fully baked, but a classic nonetheless.
It's an RPG which asks itself the question: What if the industrial revolution came to a world of elves, swords and wizardry.
We are talking the the whole lot: steam engines, electricity, inventors and scientists.

A lot of the things you now consider staples of an RPG experience, Arcanum was the first game to do
and there are some where it remains unbeaten to this day. 
Freedom to approach the quests in a number of ways. 
Seeing the gameworld acknowledge what you do and what your character is.
Yeah, it's an older game and can get clunky at times, especially working the inventory can
be a bit of an ordeal, yet its scope and influence is hard to deny.

A few tips to enjoy the game A.D.2024:
<>Read the manual. It's there, freely available to all. 
Puts you right in the mood and introduces the key terms you will be needing.
Also comes with a banana bread recipe.

<>Get the Unofficial Patch. This is essential, fixing a bunch of stuff,
most importantly the screen resolution. Don't play without it.

<>Think of a character you'd like to make which makes sense in the setting and enjoy yourself.
The game is quite accommodating to all sorts of different approaches, though some may 
be more tedious than others. Speaking from experience, a gunslinger might not be the best first pick.",1,1,0,5,0,2024-08-08,2024-08-08,0,12,203,203

"Чудова гра, улюблена гра моєї юності. Шкода, що свого часу вона так і не отримала заслуженого визнання. І шкода, що ніхто ніколи не зробить для неї перезапуску, щоб осучаснити, як зробили для того ж Діабло 2.

Очевидні плюси:

Раса і стать тут СПРАВДІ впливають на ігровий процес і проходження. НПС будуть по-різному ставитись до жінок і чоловіків, ельфів та напіворків, і т.д.

Деякі квести мають дуже сумний фінал або лишаються незавершеними, але разом з тим - все, як в житті. Якщо ти вліз у всесвітню змову сильних світу цього, то подякуй, що в принципі лишився живим, а не годуєш риб десь на дні річки.

Варіативність проходження. Можна грати за грубого тупого варвара і рубати сокирою все, що шевелиться, і ти все одно пройдеш основний квест. А можна зробити це, не вбивши жодного нпс у грі (взагалі жодного) і вирішувати всі справи перемовинами. 

Чутки у грі можуть так і залишитися чутками, а можуть вилитись в цікаві історії та квести. Це додає трохи реалізму всьому, що відбувається довкола.

Гра за технолога - це окремий витвір мистецтва. Та і загалом гра чарівником, технологом чи, наприклад, грабіжником дуже варіативна. Наприклад, деяких супутників чи нпс ви зустрінете, лише граючи за стрільця з вогнепальної зброї і т.д.

У грі є безліч фіналів і те, які рішення ви приймаєте протягом гри, СПРАВДІ на них впливають. Можна пройти гру справжнім поганцем, наплювавши на мораль та суспільство, і це вплине на твоїх супутників та на сюжетну лінію із головним антагоністом. Хочете, щоб світ горів під вашими ногами? То хай горить) це не завадить вам отримати насолоду від гри та пройти її до кінця. 

Саундтрек. Граючи в Арканум, ви закохаєтеся в класичну музику)

Пасхалки, вони всюди) 

Лор світу справді цікавий та глибокий, не зважаючи на те, що сама гра вже дуже старенька. І це додає фану.

Коротше, я можу ще сто годин розписувати всі плюси цієї гри, але краще зупинюсь тут)

Мінуси, звичайно, теж є. По-перше, це, звичайно ж, графіка. Все таки роки беруть своє, Арканум ну дуже старенький.

По-друге, він таки трохи забагований, зважаючи на те, в яких умовах випускався, але дякуючи добрим людям зі спільноти, всі ці баги легко лікуються та прибираються.

Тож, якщо ви любите атмосферу вікторіанської епохи, ельфів в корсетних платтях та гномів з вогнеметами, стімпанк та всесвітні змови, ви точно маєте пограти в Арканум. Спочатку вам може бути важко розібратися, але потім ви точно його полюбите)",1,1,0,9,0,2024-08-03,2024-08-03,76,2,2634,39
"Great worldbuilding, good storyline, average characters. Character progression is more interesting than typical CRPGs.

Combat is completely unbalanced in realtime mode, but kinda ok in turn-based mode.

This version does *not* support alt-tab (all the menus turn purple and offset). Also requires an exit every 30 minutes or so because of some glaring resource leaks. Passes the ""recommended"" threshold due to only costing like 1€.",1,1,0,8,0,2024-07-30,2024-07-30,91,81,6628,3743
"[h1] [ENG/PTBR] [/h1]

The company that originally made the game (Troika Games) no longer exists, their publisher, Sierra, is now a part of Activision Blizzard, thus, when you buy the game, your money goes to them, and since the game is pretty old, doesn't have any achievements and you need to patch it manually to run properly (both ballance and resolution fixes), there isn't any reason to acquire it on steam, besides counting your playtime (mine is bugged at the time of this review, since i've been running the game directly trought it's .exe file)

With that out of the way, well, there's no sugarcoating on this: this game is old, both on the good and bad way.

This game is absurdly well written and it's setting is one of the best, most unique options out there. But some game mechanics might aswell be esotheric knowledge before you get the hang of it, the game features a game manual (like many games of it's time) and i really recommend that you read it before playing, not only for the ingame tips, keybinds and etc, the manual has some really neat sessions explaning the lore, setting, races and such, it even has a halfling ""banana bread"" recipe near the end.

I've played as a Dwarf Technologist on my first run, and it's safe to say that, aleast to me, that way of playing seems like one of the """"""canon"""""" ones, which severely boosted my immersion on the setting and main plot. 
And speaking of immersion, arcanum isn't afraid to pack a punch.

Since i was playing as a dwarf, most of arcanum citizens weren't too fond of me initally (unless i was wearing some rich man's suit & tophat) and they weren't afraid to let me know, they even charged me extra on some inns, saying that the extra gold was due to the work that they would have cleaning the fleas and lice from the room after i was done with it.

Since i was playing as a Tech expert, i've spent a lot of time with the crafting system, and it was a lot of fun, specially when crafting silly little things like the mustard gas grenade and the flamethrower.

The setting is pretty unique, and i've enjoyed it quite a lot. Seeing the rivalry between magick and tech was a tease every time, because i couldn't stop thinking about my next run, and how i would pursue magick that time around.

To me, the only lackluster aspect of the game was it's companion system. I have no issue with companion slots being ""locked"" behind you charisma and persuasion stats, but i've felt that the individual companions were way too silent for my taste, besides some minor things like magnus saying ""hey, gimme that"" when you take his book or gloves, or any of the companions congratulating you for a critical hit.

With all that said, i definetly recommend Arcanum, in fact, it has become one of my all-time favorites.
But beware, the game is indeed very old and dated, you'll have to do some tinkering with the files for it to run smootly. 
And being a old game, it isn't afraid to beat you senseless for lack of knowledge or preparation.

A empresa que originalmente fez o jogo (Troika Games) não existe mais, e sua publisher, Sierra, foi comprada pela Activision Blizzard, por isso, quando você compra o jogo, seu dinheiro é destinado a eles. Como o jogo é velho, não tem achievements e os desenvolvedores originais não estão mais envolvidos, nada de impede de ""adquirir"" o jogo de outra forma, ainda mais sabendo que você vai precisar arrumar os patches e fixes (como de balanceamento e resolução) manualmente.

Dito isto, vamos falar do elefante na sala: o jogo é velho, do jeito bom e do jeito ruim.

Este jogo é absurdamente bem escrito e seu cenário é um dos melhores, mais únicos e mais criativos por ai, mas algumas mecânicas do jogo são praticamente conhecimento esotérico. O jogo tem um manual incluso na compra (como boa parte dos jogos da época) e eu realmente recomendo uma leitura, mas não só pelas dicas, mecânicas e etc. O manual tem bastante coisa sobre a lore e universo de arcanum, além de explicar as raças, tecnologia vs magia e etc, até tem uma receita de pão de banana la pro final.

Eu joguei de anão tecnologista na minha primeira vez, e eu sinto que esse é uma das maneiras """"""canônicas"""""" de jogar, o que aumentou muito minha imersão e interesse no plot principal, e falando de imersão, arcanum não tem medo de realmente enfatizar algumas coisas. 

Como eu estava jogando de anão, boa parte dos cidadão de Arcanum não iam muito com a minha cara (a não ser que eu estivesse usando uma cartola e terno caro, pra parecer rico) e eles não tinham medo de demonstrar isso, chegaram até a me cobrar um extra quando fui alugar um quarto em uma estalagem, falando que esse ouro era pra pagar o tempo de limpar o quarto, já que eu ia encher tudo de pulga e piolho.

Como eu joguei de tecnologista, passei boa parte mexendo com o sistema de crafting, e foi bem divertido, especialmente quando eu tava fazendo umas coisas bobinhas tipo uma granada de gás mostarda ou um lança chamas.

O cenário é realmente único, e ver a constante rivalidade entre magia e tecnologia me fez pensar em minha próxima jogatina, onde iria focar em magia para ver a diferença

Pra mim, o único aspecto paia do jogo são os companions, não tenho problema com as ""vagas"" de companion serem desbloqueadas quando você upa seu carisma e persuasão, mas eu achei eles muito silenciosos pro meu gosto, tirando algumas ocasiões menores, tipo o magnus falando ""ei, me devolve isso"" quando você pega o livro ou luvas dele, ou algum dos companions te parabenizando depois de um ataque crítico.

Enfim, eu realmente recomendo arcanum, na verdade, ele se tornou um dos meus jogos favoritos.
O jogo realmente é velho e datado, você vai ter que mexer um pouco com os arquivos pra ele rodar tranquilo.
E sendo um jogo velho, ele não tem medo de te espancar por falta de conhecimento ou preparação.",1,1,0,5,0,2024-07-29,2024-07-29,194,35,1974,1940
"This game is one of my all time most loved games. A true classic GEM! 

I will preface the review with a short note. This game being from the old days comes with some good and some bad things. And most of this is biased but thats how it goes with reviews I guess.

The good - 
1) Atmosphere / Music - really gets you immersed into the game.
2) LOADS of sidequests - even after years of playing the game I still havent done all of them.
3) Interesting game mechanics like Magic vs Tech and Good vs Evil.
4) Story/lore is well made - Character development is good, companions are interesting and you start to care about them.
5) Art style - it just clicks with my tastes 

Bad (in some sense) - 
1) No tutorial (forces you to read and explore)  - Means that the new players can have struggles with some mechanics, builds, quests. Some things in game just requires you to either know how to do things OR reading manual / google.  On the good side - there are good resources out there with walktroughs and overall I consider its a sort of benefit that the game forces you to explore and not rush trough it. And I would encourage ppl going in blind and just do things for first few playtroughs without trying to ""finish"" the game.

2) Dated graphics / Gliches - not much to be said about this - just old game will be old game. If you dig the retro feel / art style - then its not gonna bother you.


Overall I highly recommed giving this game a try. Yes it has quirks and occasional headscraching moment. BUT if you vibe with it - this game will be well worth the money.",1,1,0,2,0,2024-07-28,2024-07-28,0,7,1157,1157

Bardzo dobrze zaprojektowane lokacje, szczególnie miasta, choć są one nieco zbyt szarobure, tak wpasowują się w klimat gry.

Poza tym gra jest dosyć archaiczna i toporna, oraz miałem z nią spore problemy techniczne; po włączeniu gry przez jakiś czas próba odpoczynku lub czasem nawet wczytania sejwa powodowała crach gry (nawet mimo zainstalowanego UAP)

"I still have the original disks in storage. I bought this game new in 2001 on release and I loved it then as I do now. The setting was intriguing, the mechanics amazing and the possibilities endless! I used to sit with a notebook and work out the optimum leveling schemes for different characters. 

However that was 23 years ago, and while the setting, story, systems and characters are still amazing there are some things that need addressing:

Cons:
- The game is Janky as all hell, expect bugs, crashes, glitches etc. it was janky on release and while a lot of work has been done under the hood over the years performance remains sub optimal, there is some tweaking and compatibility settings to futz with in order to get the game running smooth, but thankfully the guides to do so are easily findable here on steam.

- Music is moody and atmospheric, but there isn't a great amount of variety, by the end you will hear violins when you close your eyes.

Neutral observations:
-+ The game does not hold your hand, if you are not paying attention you can screw up quests or build an unworkable character. This isn't a drawback to me but, I have been playing this game for almost 2 decades so please do read the manual before playing.

Pros:
+ The world is your oyster: The amount of customization and character builds available to you is staggering, everything from a Gunslinging Diplomat to a Mage who can teleport across continents and disintegrate foes with a flick of a wrist, to a neutral Melee build.

+ Characters and Quests are unique and well fleshed out, a lot of the dialogue is funny but be prepared to read as very few characters are voiced.

+ Setting: Fantasy world brought kicking and screaming into the industrial age, Magick vs. technology is a major theme in the game, in addition there are many philosophical ideas discussed and expounded by the various characters and very few are one dimensional, even the BBEG who you are fighting makes a compelling case for his actions!

+ You can recruit a dog and he is a good boy.

In conclusion:

If you enjoyed the original Fallout games (Same creator) there is a lot of their DNA in this game and it is a really great time, but please do be prepared for a certain amount of jank, I know there are fan patches but IDK how compatible they are with the steam version and now that I have done the main campaign after installing I will start screwing around with mods/patches. I bought this game on sale and paid like 1$ if it goes on sale again buy it! I highly recommend it regardless but I also have a great deal of nostalgia for the title so YMMV.",1,1,0,11,0,2024-06-25,2024-06-26,0,5,2005,2005

The roleplay options here are excellent. Playing as a character with low intelligence or beauty make for hilarious encounters.

Amazing game with a very unique setting and mechanics as far as tech vs magic. You will most likely need mods to get it running on a modern computer but it isn't too complex. Despite its age you can tell they put allot of detail into the world and the decisions you can make and how they will impact the story. They tried doing things even modern games don't to and some of it works (being able to use charisma and speech for almost any situation even big battles/ random events that you wouldn't expect. Or how people will speak differently to you depending on your race/ intelligence) and some of it is kinda janky (being able to cycle between real time and turn based combat mid fight) but all in all I would say it still stands up in many ways in 2024 especially if you're looking for a good story with a very unique setting,1,1,0,0,0,2024-06-05,2024-06-05,0,15,1333,1333

실제로 아는 사람이라면 다 알겠지만 개발사인 트로이카는 꼴랑 3개의 게임을 내고 문닫은 게임사로 게임들이 하나같이 특이한 부분이 있어 매니악한 평가를 받긴 했지만 죄다 공통적으로 심각하고 많은 버그들로 인해 게임플레이조차 제대로 하기 어려워 차후 수정패치가 필수적이었고, 그마저도 온전하지 못해 게임의 특이한 부분들에 매료된 팬들에 의해 비공식 패치가 지속적으로 이어진 후에나 어느정도 인내하며 해볼만한 수준이었다. 그 트로이카의 첫 게임으로써 이 게임도 당연히 그렇다.

게다가 버그만이 문제가 아니라 이 게임은 첫 게임이라 그런지, 게임시스템측면에서도 부실점들이 수두룩 하다. 아이템 설명의 미비 / 캐릭터 컨트롤기능의 모호 / 애매한 원거리무기들의 전투시스템 / 사실상 닥돌 평타머신이라 밖에 말할 수 없는 동료들의 AI / 오셀롯처럼 칸단위로밖에 움직일 수 없는데도 실시간 전투제의 채용 / 개별 동료 컨트롤 불가(심지어 보조전투 옵션인 턴제를 켜도 불가) / 이로 인해 동료들의 마법이나 스킬들의 사용은 사실상 거의 제한(온리 평타질) / 동료들의 인벤토리나 NPC와의 상호작용이 완전히 분리되 동료 인벤토리내 아이템은 일일히 거래시마다 주인공 인벤토리로 옮겨줘야 가능 / 그 반대도 그렇고. 한마디로 정통 CRPG의 핵심적인 동료 관련 시스템은 거의 없다시피 해서 스카이림 이상으로 동료들의 존재감이 없다시피 한 그냥 움직이는 평타머신이자 짐꾼이기에 사실상 플레이어 캐릭터가 펫들 데리고 혼자 만능캐릭터로 키워서 원맨쇼 찍으려고 하다가 난이도에 치여서 던지게 될 가능성이 높은 그런 게임이다.

여기에 시스템적으로도 게임이 불안정해서 몇시간 하면 메모리 누수라도 일어나는지 게임이 느려지고 화면이 일시적으로 꺠지거나 하다가 강종되곤 한다. (공식 패치, 비공식 패치까지 다 한게 이렇다.) 게임 후반부로 갈 수록 누적된 게임데이타가 많아서인지 점점 심해지기까지 하고.

이러니 아무리 게임의 세계관이 독특하고 스토리와 퀘스트가 흥미롭다해도 게임을 제대로 즐기기가 상당히 어렵고 짜증이 난다. 전투난이도도 낮지 않은 편이라 오죽하면 비공식 패치내에 인게임 치트기능을 추가하는 보조파일이 동봉되어 있을 정도다. 그마나 본인이 올드 게이머로 이 게임 개발자들의 이전 개발작인 폴아웃 1과 트로이카의 나머지 2개작, 템플 오브 엘레멘탈 이블과 뱀파이어 블러드라인까지 전부다 해봤던 유저이기도 했기에 그나마 이런 문제들은 감수해가며 1회차는 클리어 해봤지만 타인에게 추천까지는 진짜 못하겠다.

"I played this a lot in my childhood. Together with BG3 this is my favorite CRPG. You can do so much in the game, it's open world and you have freedom to go wherever you want. There are so many different builds and playstyles you can do a lot of completely different playthroughs. You can be megic, technology, fighter, talker, good, evil, dumb, smart, and much more. And they are all fun in their own ways, and most importantly they are very different.

Steampunk setting is fun. There is a lot of in game racism that adds another dimension to the game. Your race matters, your beauty, intelligence matters. It matters if you prefer technology or magic. It matters if you are good or evil. Everything matters and this makes it so fun.

Make sure to right away go to settings and switch to turn based combat. Real time just doesn't work well for this type of game.

"You might be looking at this thinking ‘huh, I like old school RPGs and somehow I never heard of this one, maybe it’s worth a shot’.

And you can be forgiven for thinking that, because Arcanum has a unique setting, a striking visual art style, and an amazing soundtrack. There’s a lot of really cool stuff on display here, and for 2001, it was incredibly ambitious. Heck, the manual that comes with the game [i]alone[/i] is a work of art. 

Unfortunately, there’s a reason that Troika went bankrupt. The execution is utterly abysmal. Arcanum is buggy and janky, with terrible balance and linear gameplay. The unofficial patch fixes literally hundreds of bugs, but it can’t save you from poor design. Combat, world navigation, character building, inventory management - it's all bad, underwhelming at best and actively annoying at worst.

To make matters worse, the Steam port appears to be a janky port of a janky game. Windowed mode is not on the table, and the game glitches or crashes at the drop of a hat. Again, you can spend a few hours modding your way out of some of these issues if you’re determined, but who wants to do that? Products you have to spend hours making work are bad products.

Though it has a small cohort of die-hard fans, Arcanum faded into obscurity for a reason. The game has issues, and those issues have only grown more obvious with age. I wouldn’t recommend it.",0,1,0,16,2,2024-05-10,2024-05-10,362,376,207,207

"Arcanum is a flawed yet incredibly fun rpg. The over arching story and in depth world really sucks you in and allows you to explore an interesting place with many possibilities. The game feels like a mix of DND, lord of the rings, and steam punk, in the body of the OG fallouts. It really cant be overstated how interesting the dynamics of the world are, the conflict of technology vs magic and the slow uncovering of a grand conspiracy. 

How ever there is a lot to not like about the game. To start, the game doesn't work out the box and you have to add a unofficial patch to get it to work.(look up 2 Headed Hero on youtube for how to get everything set up) Even then i experienced intermediate crashing and bugs here and there but i cant imagine how it would run without the patch. Next the game looks kinda ugly and feels dated, even for 2001. I wish it had some of the charming look for characters that fallout 1 and 2 has. The combat can be pretty intimidating at first but once you learn to switch between normal and turn based combat it feels better. Lastly my biggest criticism is the leveling and quests. We are spoiled now a days with rerollable characters and quest markers, this game has neither. You MUST play one type of character and one only otherwise when you get to the end your not gonna have a fun time. Quests also DONT have markers, so your gonna have to read everything and remember clues you may have picked up on to complete quests, no mindless running around to complete tasks here.

"DISCLAIMER: DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO MY PLAY TIME WITH STEAM. AS WITH EVERYONE ELSE, I, TOO, HAVE UTILIZED THE UAP. 
This game is very enjoyable. The world feels so alive. Decisions you make with building your character impacts how people interact with you. Although interaction in general is rather limited due to the game being made a while back, the interactions present themselves in a way that at least feels tangible. Where in Skyrim, the game's NPCs may look at your gear or race (or things you did in your playthrough as seen in the ending) and make some remark on those traits, the character choices you make in Arcanum will make everyone react to you differently. If you choose to be an ogre, not only will everyone look down upon you in general due to the reduction in Beauty that ogres get at a base by bringing it up immediately in a derogatory way, but also you will be limited to large armor sets, which may become a case where you must go on a hunt for armor that fits you. Speaking of gear, there are mainly 5 different ways of attacking in this game, with those being Melee, Bows, Guns, Throwing, and Magic. There is also some things you can do with tech to place traps and mechanical creatures, but, although I have not tried it yet, it is likely similar to the summoning tree with magic, so I will look upon it as such. Though I have not tried Throwing much yet, I can speak on all of the other ones in saying that although Bows are the most powerful, each of the others can be fun to play too. Rather than explain any of this, it would be  better if you played for yourself to determine how you want to play. That is the fun of the game; the large amount of different styles you can play held within a seemingly small interface. This game has some jank that will be cause for making the player reload a previous save, so remember to save. I have had several encounters where either my companion or an enemy will just walk off the screen and even through walls. Also, do take care in not pushing Del + Enter in an instantaneous fashion while in the load screen. Though it may be a stupid thing for me to remark on, I did it twice when trying to load saves, and there is no back up unless you make one.

"Arcanum is an old RPG game with a completely unique world - if you know ""the dark eye/das schwarze Auge"" or other well designed tabletop games, then you understand the depth you can expect. The journey will lead you all over the world finding a lot of adventures, stories and hidden secrets on the way, while the main plot is always what drives you forward (at the first playthrough) with a good deal of tension and creativity.

My recommendation (after more then hundred hours over two decades):  An amazing world that is enthralling, with a atmosphere you will find no where else - but the game is not for everyone, even RPG players may not like it, and that is because of some pain points, The old and suboptimal pathfinding and other Userinterface issues, especially the rather bad version presented here in steam does carry on what the community already fixed - more about that at the end, as well as some notes for anyone who want to give this game a try. Arcanum is old, but you can see that this game has a won the hearts of people as the community has a lot of enthusiastic fans.

Details (steam version without community patch): 
Arcanum is a unique game because of its complete worldsetting, including religion and magic theories a compley story, a melancholic atmosphere and beautiful cello music. Content wise the game is a gem! But the tools to go through the story are a bit rough, i mean the game controls, fighting system, not smooth pathfinding (or getting blocked by something) and default options. Especially the battles that feel like lightningspeed while heavy to control are sometimes frustrating if you forgot to save for a while. And you get not much information about the game systems within the game, so planning out your character is hard unless you read the manual (you should!). The complexity of the game is a challange at first - though it is what makes the game brilliant.
If you get through the start issues, keeping your belief in the game alive, you will find a game world like no other. If you think about how good this game may have felt 20 years ago (or earlier) you may understand the Arcanum fans still holding strong for this game. 
-> The complex skill system, 
-> complex character building aside from just skills, including good/evil 
-> the choices if you become mage or technician, 
-> the struggles every choice brings you in terms of not having access to other skills or not beeing liked by others for those choices - that are what makes Arcanum special. Aside from a 
-> elaborated and consistent story, worldsetting, missions, mythology and more.

Sample choices for playstyles:
-> Using Charisma as a leader - having your group members do the fights
-> Lockpicking, the way of the thief - getting good things without the need to risk your life in battle
-> Fighter, just crush everyone
-> Persuade instead of fighting
....

there are so many ways to play this game ...and of course mess up. So always do a lot of saves! And for the start make sure you play the game on easy mode (switch it in the options menu, by default it seems to be medium).

Especially if you play a smart vs. a dumb charackter you will notice a lot of different dialogue options which are fun - if you like reading.

If you are a game developer, think about getting this game to study it. Otherwise, think about if you want to have fun or a challange - if it is the latter and you enjoy melancholy and a world full of troubles, go for it. I wish you good luck and have fun.

You got the game? 
1) Then adjust the game to new standards first! Change the ""SierraLauncher.ini"" content in the SteamLibrary Arcanum Folder on your harddrive. Edit the line with Game1Cmd= to: ""Game1Cmd= -no3d -doublebuffer"" The keywords -scrolldist:0 and -scrollfps:30 may upgrade your experience further - thanks to Bluebreak for this hints (see the Arcanum Community Hub).
2) So if you want to enjoy Arcanum, think about getting the inofficial community patch which solves a good deal of problems - though this will mean, you need a shortcut and can not start it via steam directly. A well worth sacrifice in my opinion. Maybe you can skip step 1 as well.

"Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magick Obsucra is a late 90s isometric computer role playing game (crpg).  What set this game apart is the duality of magic and technology along with an actual 1:1 play area of the much quicker to travel map.  As well as the ability to toggle between real-time and turn based combat. 

While I haven't played much of this here on Steam, I played a few hundred hours on the original disk way back when it came out.  The game starts like most rpgs with you building a character.  The game is technically with out classes in the rpg sense, but I found not following a theme leads to a character that will struggle, if not outright preventing seeing very far in the game.

Concerning magick and technology, these are diametrically opposed.  The more of your character to sink into one the less the other can be used.  And the game doesn't like half measures.  So it's recommend go all in tech or all in magick.  I feel magick is much easier at the beginning of the game but wanes and often becomes inconvenient as power magick users disrupt tech and are barred from aspects of the game.  Likewise tech is tough to start as the player needs crafting materials and plans to make their inventions.  But as the plans and tech stack up, tech becomes much easier.

Of course the player can for go magick and tech, going for a more tradition fighter or rogue type.  But even there, the player is going to  want to make early tough choices on going melee or ranged focused.  I suppose a social character is possible, but I find that secondary to being able to handle combat as it is pretty unavoidable at some point.  

The actual game is a little hand-holdy (but no less challenging) as it restricts the player to a relatively small area to get them familiar with the game and managing NPC party members.  This includes a power check to get out of this area to experience the wider game.  Like other rpgs of the time, it can be slow going to scrape together tools and skills needed to progress.  If a player is not prepared for combat, it can and will go south on them very quickly.

However, if the player can get past that initial slow, rough spot; it becomes far more enjoyable.  The mysteries to solve, lands to explore, people to meet and tons of tasks to accomplish.  I will admit for as many hours that I've put into this game, I never did finish it. Don't know if I ever will as Arcanum is more involved than most games I want to sink my teeth into these days.

But it is an excellent game for anyone looking to spend tens of hours in a classic crpg.",1,1,0,0,0,2023-11-05,2023-11-05,0,184,28,28

"Arcanum to jeden z najlepszych RPGów w jakie kiedykolwiek grałem. Troika to największa tragedia w historii branży i żałuje, że nie mieli okazji zrobić więcej gier.

Wyglądem gra przywołuje na myśl klasyczne Fallouty co nie powinno dziwić, gra była stworzona przez byłych developerów z Black Isle. Świat zawiera jednak nieco więcej szczegółów wizualnych niż Fallout 2. Uraczymy tu wielu różnych lokacji; od przemysłowych miast jak Tarant po krasnoludzkie fortece, dżungle, pustynie, ruiny pradawnych cywilizacji, elfie miasto w koronach drzew etc.

Muzyka idealnie wpasowuje się w klimat świata przechodzącego przez rewolucję przemysłową. Prawie wszystkie utwory zawierają skrzypce. Jest tylko kilka gier, gdzie muzyka w głównym menu przykuła mnie do siedzenia; Arcanum jest jedną z nich. Jedynie muzyka towarzysząca nam w trakcie walki szybko robi się nużąca. Dubbing stoi na wysokim poziomie i jest więcej postaci mówiących niż grach Black Isle.

Rozgrywka jest dosyć dziwna, mamy opcje aby w każdej chwili przejść z walki turowej na czas rzeczywisty. Walka w czasie rzeczywistym jest nieporęczna i ma problemy (np. magia i strzelanie z łuku jest zależne od tego jak szybko klikasz, więc łucznicy strzelają z prędkością karabinu). Prowadzi to do systemu gdzie zmieniamy tryb walki zależnie od tego, który możemy lepiej wykorzystać.

Fabuła jak i świat napisane w genialny sposób, wszystko się ze sobą łączy, postaci są barwne i interesujące, a zwroty akcji zaskakują w pozytywny sposób. Rozmowa z ostatecznym bossem jest na poziome rozmowy z Mistrzem z Fallout 1. Dużo mógłbym pisać, ale świat przedstawiony jest po prostu mistrzowsko wykonany.

Gra ma wiele mocno rozwiniętych systemów. 16 szkół magii, 8 dyscyplin technologicznych, walka bronią palną, bronią białą, łukami etc. Reakcje NPC na rasę naszej postaci wyróżniają się na tle innych gier z gatunku. W nowoczesnych RPG uraczymy co najwyżej jakiegoś komentarza na temat naszego pochodzenia. W Arcanum to kim gramy zmienia np. cenę łóżka w hotelu, pierwsze wrażenie ludzi na nasz temat, predysponowany build postaci (np. Elfy mają minus do posługiwania się bronią palną).

Dużym minusem jest to, że gra jest antyczna, i nie da się w nią grać bez patchy. Przydałaby się jakaś wersja HD, nowoczesne wydanie.",1,1,0,0,0,2023-10-22,2023-12-04,0,31,3105,3105

"Fantasy equivalent of Fallout 1 or Fallout 2. Very well done. Lots of cool hidden functions and alternative ways to solve problems. Good sandbox adventure style RPG. Good, evil, and neutral sandbox options well explored. Open world without lots of loading screens. Has options for real time and turn based combat. Classless character design with lots of customization. Great game, lots to explore. 

That said, if you've never played old PC RPGs before, and want a modern understanding: This game is equal in quality to a very well done RPG maker game. Yes, it very pre-dates those, but treating it as if it were made recently, that is what it is.

Of minor concern, game has pretty major compatibility issues with win 10, so need to install 3rd party patches to make it run. Once installed, works really great. No problems at all. 

Beyond that, game is unusual when compared to modern RPGs in that gender greatly determines game options even at the character creation level, and further, there are very few non-white character portrait options (and the non-white ones are for green orcs and such, not other human ethnicity). No gay options either. Makes for a very in-setting character creation, but if looking for these modern features/political correctness in your RPGs, it lacks them. There's even a built in ""dumb dialog"" for characters with lacking intelligence (which could be construed as mocking the mentally handicapped) and slurred speech for inebriated characters.

Oh, regarding the ESRB rating, yes, it should be Mature in the sense that it checks the boxes that qualify, but it isn't really a mature game in the modern sense. Probably closer to Teen, these days. Graphics are rather cartoony compared to modern games. ""Blood"" is present, but looks more like red paint spills and little red sparks and sometimes limbs fall off in a very cartoonish way. There is lots of violence, but it's like a chess level of violence. There is swearing, but not swearing for the sake of swearing (some modern games seem to do this). There is only avoidable & consensual sex (which is described/implied but not animated). There is slavery and also unfair working conditions. There is drug use (potions, poison, medicine, and alcohol, plus implied tobacco use). It does satire religion, features a polytheistic setting, and not really give any credibility to their ""gods"" or the faithful. There are demons within the setting. The player is allowed to play an evil character: kill, steal, use necromancy, and otherwise commit crimes/sins. And the setting is very heavy in racism (between the fictional fantasy races, not between skin tones).",1,1,0,1,0,2023-10-20,2023-11-11,0,42,2862,2285
"Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura was the first game from Troika Games, an outfit formed by Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson, who all worked on Fallout 2 at Interplay.

It's an isometric RPG set in a steampunk/fantasy world, and plays a lot like the Infinity Engine games (Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale 1 & 2), but with some significant differences.  For example, it does not use the D&D ruleset, and the combination of magic and technology means there are interesting locations, items and different ways to solve quests.

I needed to install an unofficial patch and mess around with the launch settings to get it to run properly. It crashed multiple times. Combat for an early-game mage revolved entirely around spamming the Harm spell and hoping you didn't run out of fatigue, then leaving the dungeon, recovering, and going back in until you ran low on fatigue again. The soundtrack is entirely performed by a string quartet, which is a cool concept but gets old pretty quickly. The mere thought of Magnus Shalefist makes me want to start a new file specifically so I can disintegrate him before he opens his mouth. 

Normally, I wouldn't give this a negative review because, if I had decided to stick with a game like this, I'd have chucked my computer out the window and wouldn't be able to access Steam.

However, the depth and openness of the world, the little twists and turns in the story, the rather innovative (for the time, anyway) setting, and the sense that you could play this game over and over again and only scratch its surface, more than make up for its myriad faults. I just finished the game, and I kinda wanna start it all over again. 

If I give into the temptation, then buddy, Shalefist better watch his godsforsaken back.",1,1,0,0,0,2023-10-19,2023-10-19,0,42,2146,2146

"No words to describe this game and the world it's set in.
Granted, what you probably heard elsewhere about it's flaws is 100% true:
-Combat wise this is by far (and i mean BY FAR) the worst Crpg ever probably...it's clunky as hell even with tons of patching and modding, the turn based mode barely works while real time is completely broken and exploitable (the spell ""harm"", even at level 1, can be spammed as fast as you can click your mouse...that's borderline access to infinite damage right away)
-It's still pretty buggy even after all these years, tho likely stuff that breaks quests/progression is fairly rare, and in my multiple playthroughs throughout the years i only got stuck once (so yeah..it's one of those games where you keep around 10 save files and keep cycling through them in case the last 1 or 2 break..)
-The world backgrounds and locales, while they create a very unique and interesting world, feel kinda sparse compared to other Crpgs from the same era like Fallout 1, Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment or even more obscure stuff like Ruins of Mythdranor...it's weird to describe, but i ve always felt as if places like the initial crash site look like someone threw a bunch of lego pieces on a grass-earth looking background.
-I reccomend further modding + not launching it directly from Steam to avoid various technical problems (years ago i wrote a guide on how to optimize the game, but it was for the original version, and doesnt apply to Steam/GoG versions, which have their own problems..)

...and yet, despite all these major flaws, this is to this day one of the best Crpgs you can play.
It drags you into a story and a setting like no other, with a maniacal attention to lore and detail that has rarely been replicated (highly reccomend reading the gigantic manual just to have a taste) and the ability to build the type of character you want is staggering even today, and to put it simply..there has never been another game that quite feels like it, and the story toward the end takes a completely unexpected but welcomed turn.

"A great blast from the past for people with a taste for complex CRPGs, which is also capable of annoying you to death if you are not used to old games. Arcanum is set in the 1880s in a fictional world bearing the same name. A place torn by the wars between the Cumbrian kingdom and UK (Unified Kingdom). Steam locomotives are piercing the continent while people are figuring out how to adapt to the post-war rise of technology. Industrialization has left many agrarian cities abandoned, creating wider economic gaps between the common people and nobles. A socio-cultural and physical conflict between two forces has divided people even further. The older unnatural forces of Magick clash with the new Technology, which conversely lends the principle of Natural Law. This is the first choice you have to make as you create your character in Arcanum. 

The classless system, 16 skills, 16 spell colleges, and 8 tech disciplines (all broken down into multiple degrees) allow for huge flexibility in character progressions. Due to the aptitude scale your main decision will boil down to either going the magick or tech route. (Although I've seen hybrid technomage builds circulating online.) For my first playthrough, I went with a charismatic mage that relies on followers doing the hard work while I blast spells from the sidelines. If you are struggling with choosing a path, you can never go wrong with a simple melee built with high Charisma (with Persuasion skill) and decent Intellect. The melee focus will help you survive, and the social skills/stats will allow for a fun playthrough with interesting dialogue options and companions' support. 

Your voyage starts on the board of a blimp attacked by kamikaze orcs. A few moments later, you find yourself in the foothills of the Stonewall Range, being the only survivor of the crash. You are given a mysterious ring and a dreadful warning about the end of the world. Charged with the mission to find the origin of the artifact, you start your journey. 

You are introduced to the world of Arcanum — a cut-throat steampunk (kind of.. but more on that in a bit), cultural hodgepodge brimming with intrigue, violence, and racism. If you have played any other vanilla D&D games, the races will feel familiar, except for the half-ogres. The only difference is that everybody hates everybody in Arcanum. My little gnome character was socially annihilated from the very first moment I met NPCs. Here, even halflings are not tolerant of other creatures of small stature. 

Although set in a fiction world, the in-game year alludes to the setting being a typical Victorian-era steampunk. That's where my first minor pet peeve comes with the game. 19th-century Victorian architecture is characterized by its steeped roofs, brick walls, turrets, verandas, and fireplaces. The buildings in Arcanum, with their flat rooftops, cement walls, and clean lines, resemble more of a 20th-century industrialism. The fashion in the game doesn't help with that, as most suits look like tailored for 1940s mobsters. I get it; it is a fantasy world, so who says it has to be your typical steampunk, but it's just hard for me to grasp the vibe of the setting due to the unclear visuals and graphics limitations of the time. Put in other words, visually, the game never felt like steampunk to me and just lacked solid art direction to solidify the depth of the world. 

That leads us to the next big issue of Arcanum: the poor and unclear UI. While the system is not abhorrently difficult to get the hang of, you'd need to play Arcanum with a manual, a glossary to understand all of the abbreviations and unexplained mechanics, and a map, as some locations are hard to find unless you have the pdf map and force walk to specific coordinates. Words like MSR, FT, NP, MA are a staple of the game interface, yet no tooltips are provided to explain what the same mean. Minimum Strength Required, Fatigue, Noise Penalty, and Magical Aptitude. Some stats like Total attack and Total defense are kept nebulous even in the manual, and I couldn't find any explanation anywhere else as to how these are calculated. Tip: The GOG version of Arcanum comes with all of the collateral resources needed to play the game more smoothly (like the high-res map), so it's worth checking it out. That said, the Steam copy also has the manual if you look into your steamapps folder of Arcanum. 

The movement and pathfinding in the game are the worst I have experienced on Windows (not counting old DOS games). Not being able to click beyond a certain point and being forced to draw a waypoint line with a limited number of points (as the easier alternative to rage-clicking across the map) is annoying as hell. I remember playing games from this era. Baldur's Gate 2 was launched in 2000, one year earlier than Arcanum, and I can't recall experiencing such issues with UI/movement. 

The combat is super frantic. With not-so-obvious action point indications, tracking what's going on is hard, even in turn-based mode.

If you are able to overlook and get used to the outdated graphics, uncomfortable UI, and lack of important quality-of-life features, you'll love Arcanum. It's an epic adventure with all of the ingredients of a great CRPG: a good story, a complex character system, fight/cunning/wits quest-solving, and unmatchable reactivity of the world based on your character choices. 

Before you start the game:

[list]
    [*]Download the manual and the guide from Prima available for free via archive.org
    [*]Download and install the unofficial patch to fix resolution and bugs. Read the readme file and enable infinite scrolling.
    [*]Make sure running is turned on by default.
[/list]

Tips for playing the game:

[list]
    [*]It's likely your first character(s) will be sh*t. Do a test run until you figure out your build.
  [*]Recruit Virgil, at least for your maiden run. He provides a lot of context for the main story arc, as well as much-needed healing and poison halt spells.
  [*]Save as often as you can and in new slots, especially before traveling. Random encounters during travels can often be unbalanced.
  [*]When looting bodies, make sure to take their equipped items, too. These will not show in the default loot bag; you need to click on the circle body icon next to the bag icon or the red arrow to collect all items. Only when it says that there's nothing to loot it means there's nothing to loot from the body.
  [*]If a stat shows red the two most common culprits are an item that reduces the stat (a helm, for example) or a condition like scarred, which can reduce your beauty. You can find your conditions in the Kills & Injuries log
  [*]Advancing time does not heal HP, but you can sleep in the outskirts of any town for free which would recover HP.
  [*]There are generally 3 ways to solve quests, especially as pertaining to the main arc - slay, steal, or persuade (also known as force/wits/stealth in game design). You need good damage input, pickpocketing, or persuasion skills, respectively.  
 [*]You don't need to focus on one single approach, but if you are bad at all three, you'd have a hard time.
[/list]

Since I played as a mage, here are some tips for magick users:

[list]
[*]Most important stats for mages are WP and DX - the first increases fatigue, and second your action points, so both help you cast more spells faster during combat without falling unconscious. 
[*]You don't need more than 12 IN. The rest of the stats will depend on your liking and build bug; generally, PE is a dump stat. If you want to build a charismatic leader, focus on CH. For battle mages, you can focus on ST and DX. 
[*]MA is critical for your mage. The higher it is, the more dmg you score with dmg spells. To increase it you can start with an Elf and learn more spells.
[*] The best dmg dealing spells are Harm (single enemy) and Fireflash (AOE). Utility spells like teleport and unlock cantrip are critical in making your life easier.

https://terra-arcanum.com/drog/uap.html

Installation is automatic, you only need to locate Arcanum folder during instalation (\Steam\steamapps\common\Arcanum\Arcanum), where you can also select additional optional installs. I recommend that you select High Resolution patch and Official DLC. 

After install you must first select resolution (max 1600x900 or similar, depends on the screen) for the game in the file \Steam\steamapps\common\Arcanum\Arcanum\HighRes\config.ini), and then run install.bat in the same folder so the game will update the resolution. 

You cannot run directly Arcanum from Steam launcher, so create desktop shortcut directly to Arcanum.exe file in the folder (\Steam\steamapps\common\Arcanum\Arcanum).

"Настоящий бриллиант нашего времени. Подобных историй не осталось. Она чарующая, самодостаточная и очень очень смелая. 

Всё по канонам RPG игр. У нас тут и классы и рассы и статы и система диалогов, в общем, разгуляться есть где. 
Да, я согласен, графика очень устарела, однако с патчами от фанатов есть клёвые hd текстуры.

В игру можно зайти на час, а потеряться на пять. Мир на столько заставляет погрузиться, поверить в него, что банально не остаётся места для скуки. В 80% случаев ты постоянно чем то занят, будь то шедевральные диалоги или даже довольно занятный менеджмент ресурсов, если ты технолог. Игра даёт тебе в неё играть, и не показывает тебе своих пустых мест, она не делает из тебя кретина, поэтому и ты не делай из неё то, чем она не является. Тут крайне насыщенная на события сюжетная линия. Множество колоритных, запоминающихся персонажей. 
Самое необычное это конечно же сеттинг, но знаете, Arcanum не только этим может вас удивить и поразить ;)  Как разработчики умудрились соединить в лор магию и технологию, при этом не нарушить логику происходящего, это просто моё почтение. 
Кстати на счёт магии. Чуваки, сколько ж в игре можно сделать билдов основанных на магии, это просто axyй. На любой вкус, и классик маг и некромант и хилящая магия в тандеме с защитными бафами, о да, огорчиться количеством спелов попросту невозможно. 
Кстати, если вас не упёрлась ни магия, ни технологии, есть вариант создать самого простецкого война или лучника, а может даже разбойника, эти классы будут вполне самодостаточными, но ведь так захочется поэкспериментировать.

"Every time I replay this game, I am shocked by how much content it has and how much love went into it.

It has a rather unusual setting: a traditional fantasy world undergoing an industrial revolution, with technology and magic reacting violently to one another. And yet, this setting is somehow made to feel realistic. Disgruntled mages riding at the back of the train (far from the engine), exploited half-orc factory workers fighting to unionize, the gnome oligarchy controlling things behind the scenes, conservative nations failing to adapt to the rise of technology, scientists and explorers trying to make sense of the world, multiple conspiracies, it's all there and it works fantastically well.

The world is almost entirely open almost right away (there's a ""tutorial"" town), and everywhere you go, tons and tons of quests. Almost all of them with multiple ways to solve them, and often related to other quests or characters in a way that makes the world feel more consistent. With sufficient intelligence, charisma and persuasion, you can talk your way out of almost anything, including the last boss. It's often integrated to game mechanics, too: if you want Master training in Persuasion, you don't simply pay the trainer... no, you'll instead be asked to negotiate with another nation about joining the union and given a book detailing possible compromises and outcomes on ten different negotiation points, which you'll have to take to a council and adjust your position during negotiations to get as much as you can while still getting to an agreement. There's a quest for each of the 16 skill masteries and there's always a catch. Sometimes a really big one, such as the Dodge Master requiring you to kill the Melee Master, and possibly rescue the woman they're both fighting over. That's how deep they took things.

At the time of this writing, the game is over two decades old. There's an unofficial patch that makes it run fine and fixes bugs that made it into the release version of the game. The game itself is a little clunky mechanically speaking, but still very much playable, especially since you can switch between Real Time and Turn-Based combat to suit the encounter.

"One of my favorite games of all time, Arcanum melds classic RPG characteristics with classic PC gaming characteristics, bundled into a package of poor graphics and an engine that wasn't designed with the future in mind. There's a few mods out there that improve the gameplay and performance quite a bit, but I truly do wish there was a bigger presence for modding, or even the possibility of a remaster.

As a player I felt lost and without walkthroughs wouldn't have seen more than a third of the game. Somehow for me immersion was lacking.

"A great CRPG set in a relatively unique Steampunk setting. 
Arcanum: Of Steamworks And Magick Obscura Arcanum isn't quite up there with Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 2 or Planescape: Torment due to various reasons. Still, I highly recommend this obscure game to anyone that likes Western RPG's as it's amazing.
One unique aspect is a scale that goes between Magick and Technology, where you can choose if you want to be more like a mage or a gun-slinging cowboy
Some negatives are that it has pretty bad graphics and it can be very buggy at times. The graphics don't take anything away from an immersive, enjoyable experience in a complicated, unique world filled with a good plot, fascinating lore and even some social commentary. 
There is a decent learning curve but it's not too hard to get a hold of.

"What a wild RPG. I play this and really miss Troika as a studio. They never really ever had the time, budget, or luxury to make the games they wanted to make. 

Arcanum is definitely one of those flawed precious stones you find while slogging through a Sierre Leone blood diamond mining operation knee deep in mud and gore. 

Lucky for us, this rough hewn gem is the size of a car. It’s flawed. It has systems that make no sense. There’s hardly anything user friendly. Most importantly it’s one of the jankiest games you’ll play. BUT. It’s one of the rarest forms of rpgs out there, the kind that really let you roleplay with a capital R. 

The builds are limitless, the way the game responds to you as a character in its world are boundless, and it does something that other games can only dream of - give you true choice and consequence. Sure, most of it is superficial and you’re just going to end up doing the things it wants you to do anyway, but how you get there is all up to you. 

I like this game, but it’s definitely not for everyone. It’s a game that will probably never have a follow up in a world that deserves at least two more entries. It’s the Firefly of RPGs. If you can get past this, it’s one of the long lost forgotten entries in the RPG genre that may have you staring at your ceiling at night wishing beyond hope for a sequel.

It’s really unique and one of a kind. 

I will never play another RPG quite like it ever again, and that whimsically forlorn sentiment keeps bringing me back time and time again.

Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura is a role-playing game set in a fantasy world where magic and technology coexist, but are often in conflict. The game has been praised for its original setting, rich story, and complex character creation system. However, it has also been criticised for its technical issues, outdated graphics, and unbalanced gameplay.

The world of Arcanum is unique - it combines elements of steampunk, Victorian era, and high fantasy to create a diverse and immersive environment. The player can encounter elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, vampires, werewolves, and more in different regions of the world, while also having a wide variety of character customisation in terms of starting race/gender etc. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, and each background has significant bonuses as well as drawbacks. The game also explores the themes of racism, classism, industrialisation, and religion through its various factions and characters. You can choose to align with either magic or technology, which affects skills, abilities, and reputation. Magic users can cast spells from different schools of magic, such as fire, necromancy, or summoning. Technology users can craft and use various gadgets, such as guns, bombs, or automatons. The game also features a morality system that tracks the player's actions and consequences. Depending on their choices, the player can become good or evil, lawful or chaotic (alignment will also affect NPC responses and in some cases, which companions are willing to join your party).

The game also boasts a rich story that is influenced by the player's decisions. The main plot revolves around the player being the sole survivor of a zeppelin crash that was caused by a mysterious assassin. The player then learns that they are the reincarnation of an ancient hero who once saved the world from a powerful evil. Along the way, the player can recruit up to seven companions who have their own personalities and backgrounds. There are multiple endings depending on the player's actions and alignment (combine this with the widely varied starting race/background, and replayability is very high indeed).

However, Arcanum is not without its flaws. The game suffers from many technical issues that affect its performance and stability. It game is prone to crashing, freezing, or glitching at random moments (ALT-TAB is a lottery most of the time, and I suffered from the notorious slowdown which really made it quite painful). The game also has many bugs that can break quests or cause other problems - some of which can be solved by installing UAP. Ideally, before beginning, you will want to run through the links and process on this most helpful post ([url]https://www.reddit.com/r/arcanum/comments/s0vuib/arcanum_patches_for_new_players/[/url]) (in fact, you may need to do so to get the game to run in the first place). I had to install version 2.0.2 of the UAP in order to play the game, and as a result of the difficulties I faced I was unwilling to fiddle around to resolve the slowdown bug. If your luck is better than mine, the below may come in handy if you encounter this (all credit to OP):

Before you begin playing, you may also want to make use of the below two guides (all credit to respective OPs):
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2311393823
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755978234
The game is quite complex and it will help to familiarise yourself with some of the mechanics before diving in.

Finally, many of the files as well as extras are hosted at [url]https://terra-arcanum.com/downloads/[/url] should you need it, or the other links not work.

The gameplay is also unbalanced and frustrating at times. For combat, you can switch between real-time and turn-based (turn-based is the generally accepted way to play Arcanum, but there will be times when you need to switch between the two). However, the combat is often chaotic and confusing due to the lack of feedback and control. The difficulty is also inconsistent and unfair at times - some enemies are too easy to defeat while others are too hard to overcome, with the curve seemingly flattened as you approach the end. The AI is also erratic and unreliable: The companions often act stupidly or get stuck in obstacles, and the programming does not always make sense (why do my ranged companions decide to get in close to attack? Make it make sense).

Arcanum is a game that has a lot of potential but also a lot of problems. This will appeal most to fans of classic role-playing games who appreciate its originality and depth. However, it is also a game that frustrates players who expect more polish and balance, and requires patience and tolerance to enjoy its merits to the fullest.

Played on Windows 11 Pro x64. It was not a simple task to get this game to work - in addition to the above, I had to create a custom override in Windows Security for Mandatory ASLR and force it to off. Without this, the game would not launch at all.",1,1,0,27,0,2023-05-22,2023-05-22,0,169,2795,2795
"Oh, dearie me! I recently tried my hand at this peculiar game called Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, and let me tell you, it was quite the experience. Now, mind you, I couldn't quite make out those pesky dialogue options, but I soldiered on regardless. By the way, have I mentioned Amanda from the church choir and her suspicious ways at Bingo? But I digress...

Arcanum presents itself as a fascinating world full of steam-powered contraptions and magical wonders. However, it's as if the game itself conspires against me, dear reader. The dialogue options elude my poor, tired eyes, leaving me utterly bewildered. It's a shame, really. Just like Amanda and her bingo shenanigans.

As I stumbled through this game, attempting to navigate its intricacies, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. The lack of clear guidance made it difficult to truly immerse myself in the story. And let me tell you, dear Amanda, the church choir deserves better than someone who cheats in Bingo! Oops, there I go again, forgive me!

The combat system, oh my, it's a peculiar beast! It felt clunky and unrefined, much like Amanda's habit of snatching the winning card before anyone else has a chance. But I won't dwell on her dubious tactics any longer, my apologies.

The visuals, while dated, still possess a certain charm. The world of Arcanum is unique and intriguing, with its mix of technology and magic. If only the game's mechanics were as enchanting as the church choir's harmonies, minus Amanda's disruptive antics, of course.

In all honesty, dear reader, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura left me feeling somewhat exasperated. The lack of accessibility for those of us who struggle with deciphering the dialogue options dampened my enthusiasm. And speaking of dampening things, Amanda's presence in the church choir dampens the spirit of fair play.

While I appreciate the game's ambition and its potential to captivate others, it simply did not resonate with me. Perhaps if Amanda learned to play fair in Bingo, I might have had a more positive outlook on Arcanum. But alas, such is life.

In summary, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura left me longing for a more user-friendly experience. Much like Amanda and her Bingo tactics, the game felt frustrating and inaccessible. Ah, Amanda, Amanda, when will you learn? But I digress. Proceed with caution, dear reader, and may your adventures be less confounding than mine.",1,1,0,6,1,2023-05-22,2023-05-22,240,77,2021,2021

Fabuła jest głęboka, pełna moralnych dylematów i decyzji, które naprawdę wpływają na świat i sposób, w jaki potoczy się historia.

С грустью смотря на то что выпускают ныне, я надеюсь что когда нибудь появится новая часть этой легендарной игры, и я смогу еще немного насладиться тем незабываемым опытом который дарит мир Арканума в котором так много возможностей. Любите магию? для вас широкий спектр возможностей, среди которых воскрешение мертвых, контроль разума и даже аннигиляция противников в одно мгновение. Любите технологии? Сконструируйте себе пушку, которая стреляет молниями и паровой доспех, который защитит от самых свирепых противников, а если не справляетесь сами можете создать целую армию механических роботов. Если пути магии и технологии вас не прельщают или вы хотите идти по своему индивидуальному пути у вас есть полная свобода для прокачки, здесь нет ограничений. Можно плюнуть на все и по классике прорубать путь верным мечом, стать настоящим вором, который может пройти незамеченым мимо врагов и присвоить их добро, или даже стать настоящим дипломатом, который способен даже главного злодея уговорить сдаться без боя! Вы можете стать героем, помогая всем на своем пути или стать злодеем, истребляя всех кто не по нраву, либо же просто делать то что угодно лишь вам.

"A beautifully broken game that never gets old. I have loved Arcanum since it's release in 2001. A good majority of the fun is constantly trying new builds and backgrounds. There's plenty of customization and it's always wonderful when you can add your own portraits and create your own backgrounds.

Play your way! Want to be evil and slaughter everyone in your path? Go for it. Want to be a goody two-shoes who never does a thing wrong? You got it. Want to just wander aimlessly and slaughter random enemies in the wilderness with powerful magic or blow them up with technology? You can do that, too!

The story is good and definitely serviceable for the game. While magic is rather broken if you take certain spells, any way you play this game is quite fun. Diplomats, gunslingers, sword and board, mage, sneaky thief, assassin...the choice is yours! The voice acting is well done (though quite a few get annoyed with Virgil). One thing to keep in mind is even though there's a real time combat option in this game, it's best to play this turn based. You'll find yourself getting frustrated in real time, especially if you're some kind of ranged fighter.

The AI of the game is quite stupid, but you really don't need a fully functioning AI for the combat. Combat is simple enough that you don't have to plan a lot of tactics after the first couple of hours (hard difficulty). You can choose to follow the main story as you see fit. I prefer to take my time and explore, but it's there when you're ready. I have always highly recommended this game to those who love turn based RPGs or something with a decent/good story.",1,1,0,0,0,2023-04-17,2023-04-17,0,32,7587,4080
"22.5 years have passed since the release. Back then I would give the game 101% out of 100% for Fallout in a steampunk-fantasy crossover.
However, time has passed I got acquainted with many non-inferior games, and I may even write a short non-biased review.
TLDR: Recommended if isometric graphics doesn't make you sick, and if you don't mind that 85% of the game are a slasher while the remaining 15% are an RPG.

[b]Main story[/b]: generic, another Chosen one, but edible for a Fallout 1-2 successor in 2001. It is definitely blatant in 2023, but at least having some twists, although barely logical.

[b]Sub-stories[/b]: range from awful to awesome; mostly generic. It feels like the devs were running out of time before the release, and there are many starting points which have no follow-up. The weirdest thing is that your character has literally NO connection to the world of Arcanum. In one of the dialogues, your elf character says that she/he is from another continent, but that's literally it. So, this is not the game where you may expect any personal development of your pawn.

[b]Rule of Three[/b]: (strength, stealing, speaking) is only applied to some of the plots. Example: There are 31 Persuasion checks in total, 17 of which require 2 skill points out of 5 max -- the more you invest, the less useful Persuasion becomes. Also, it's worth to note that you may speak your main antagonist to death.
Another example is that the game is filled with unique super-items. To get them you need 2 ""S"": stealing or strength. There is no option to get them with charisma/money.

[b]Followers[/b]: include several interesting guys and gals. Many of them appear in the late game, so there is literally no value to exchange your current party members. The worst is their behaviour in combat, especially mages. E.g., an awesome archeress transforming her body into a water elemental and kicking enemies in melee. OR, an evil mage hitting enemies in melee barehanded instead of casting harmful spells.

[b]Combat[/b]: Real-time and Turn-based--both unbalanced. Before level 10, most fights are a neverending sequence of misses. After level 10, most fights end faster than a blink of an eye.
Old-fashioned melee is a god in this game.
Magic is cool, but you need to know meta.
Bows/Throwing are easy because based on the most useful stat--Dexterity.
Firearms suck as you need the second lamest stat--Perception. The good thing is that you may still create a successful gunslinger mage.
Technology gimmicks are too complicated for the fast pace of the battles.
As for the enemies, they act like your Followers in most cases -- all mages almost never use magic, and instead run in melee, unless they have a ranged weapon.

[b]Magic vs Technology concept[/b]: Nice at a first glance, unbalanced towards magic later in the game, both suck at the end because melee destroys everything (if you play without exploits).
Magic itself is pretty generic -- you invest a skill and get an ability.
Technology is more interesting -- you invest a skill and get a scheme. Then you collect ingredients/details and based on these and other purchasable schemes you create a device.
There is a catch, most technician Followers never invest more than 4 out of 7 skills in a technical discipline. So, to try all the devices expect replaying the game. This is somewhat mitigated by the Unofficial Patch, but you need to turn-off the auto levelling for Followers.

[b]Shady stuff[/b]: the developers literally push you to steal from everyone. They even introduced some noise and awareness mechanics and left several 'clever gaming' alternatives. Example, the doors to NPC's bedrooms are generally locked, but you may easily enter when NPC goes to sleep or gets up. Then wait for night, NPC will go to sleep ignoring you, and…
There are also several hexed items with poison. You may leave such item on the floor, an NPC will automatically pick it up, put on and die. After looting, you may even resurrect this NPC who will even be grateful.

[b]Game economics[/b]: Playing as a thief or a mage with the unlocking spell, it's easy -- just loot your favourite vendor.
Playing a technical (especially following Explosives discipline), it's quite easy to find a proper prosperity formula. This also applies to a player with a technical follower.
For a non-thieving mage or non-thieving fighter, it's harder, because your resources are limited, and you may even need to farm random encounters when you're requested 50000 late in the game. [spoiler]It's possible to avoid paying the money with a skill or by completing a long quest chain.[/spoiler]
For non-ugly females, you may get a permanent part-time position in the most ancient occupation.

Arcanum is rather unique in its world setting: Victorian age with Orcish Trade Unions, Gnomish Conspiracy and OP Elves.
Arcanum introduces crafting system which is different from the trite survival craft, or from the standard ""copper->bronze->iron->steel->mythril->adamantine"" sequence.
Arcanum allows throwing grenades and deploying robots, regardless your character is a magic or technology user.
Arcanum allows your character to be ugly, but charming and still beat the game (relying on your bodyguards).
Arcanum allows your character quite an opposite thing: stand there beautiful, but dumb, and still beat the game.
Arcanum is rather easy even in its hard mode.",1,1,0,2,0,2023-04-17,2023-04-17,0,24,5959,5959
"Probably the definitive RPG. the mix of magic vs technology is amazing alongside the race wars of orcs, elves and dwarfs vs the human world. yeah it needs some mods, it has some glitches. the game play is ancient and the graphics show their age, but this game has what all other rpg games have wished they had. its not just the story line and deep side quests, not just the multiple choice scenarios and open world play style... or unloading shotguns and hand grenades at religious nut jobs, monsters and mages.  The pure idea this game portrays and the world its set in is worth all the drawbacks, it was amazing when released over 20 years ago and all tho its been beaten in game play and graphics by so many games.... their beauty is only skin deep in comparison. there still isnt an RPG close to the  amazingly detailed world of arcanum, Arcanum is amazing",1,1,0,0,0,2023-04-15,2023-04-15,0,3,1549,835

"An easy game to enjoy for anyone looking for a deep, classic RPG experience. The games mechanics are top notch, and in a few ways groundbreaking. I really enjoyed the classless system that focuses leveling the character you want to play. Every play through end up wanting to a little of everything, and I love games that make that type of class building approachable.

The story and world building shines in this game. I've played few games with this deep level of magic combined with steampunk. It's such an interesting mix in time period and fantasy that it's a shame we get so few examples of this working.

"Арканум как оказалось представитель все еще очень редкого жанра стимпанка сосуществующий с магией и если поискать схожий жанр, то дальше фейбл 3 и дисхонора вы ничего не найдете, от чего игра остается уникальной и по сей день.

Лично для меня после прохождения первых фолачей, заметно невероятное изменение в виде удобного интерфейса, где быстро и понятно можно торговаться и менять экипировку без вечного прокручивания вниз в поиске нужного предмета.

Визуально игра радует глаз, т.к. перед нами очень стильный мир, который не подвергся апокалипсису, но сами текстуры заметно устарели и необходимо накатывать hd-mod.

Квесты радуют разнообразием и возможностями их выполнения, где казалось простое задание иди принеси предмет может стать полноценным приключением на целый час. Так же не может не радовать, то что для освоение полноценного мастерского перка, нам для этого нужно будет пройти персональный квест.

Основной сюжет весьма неплох, но мотивация главного героя выполнять дальнейший сюжет после первого задания, снова сомнительное, т.к. при создании персонажа мы выбираем ему какую-либо предысторию, и игра это все так же никак не использует для личного квеста протагониста.

Конфликт технологии и магии как по мне вообще не раскрыт в должной мере. Игра вроде позиционирует себя тем, что магия увядает из-за индустриализации мира, но кроме геймплейного метрика, где наш герой становится круче в той или иной степени при прокачке своих способностей, я не заметил. (еще нпс могут перестать с тобой общаться и торговать если ты слишком сильно развился в 1 стезю). А сам мир уже как бы поделен на разные направления мира.

Вновь у напарников нет личных квестов, но есть моменты, где при попадании напарника в нужное место, там выясняется его сюжетная принадлежность к миру, что весьма неплохо дает сюжетные твисты) И даже не знаю куда отнести новую фишку компаньонов, в плюсы или минусы. Они теперь научились вне зависимости от действия игрока лутать противников, что порой выводится в казусы, когда ты ищешь ключевой предмет, а его оказывается умудрялся поднять твой кореш.

По итогу хочется верить, что если балдур 3 у нас на пороге релиза, то м.б. такая уникальная игра как арканум удостоиться не просто ремастера, а настоящего ремейка или сиквела, т.к. по всей своей совокупности, она до сих пор остается единственной в своем роде не только благодаря уникальному миру, но и возможности кардинально пройти игру совершенно другим классом персонажа.",1,1,0,3,0,2023-03-19,2023-03-19,767,145,3600,3600

"[h1]It's actually 100+ hours with the unofficial patch - its launcher isn't tracked by Steam.[/h1]

I have to say, for a game that's now a few [strike]centuries[/strike] decades old, it's still a joy to play. There is a lot of custom build options to choose from, and from an rpg perspective, this is a fantastic start.

Arcanum is a world in the grip of what I like to think of as a cold war between technology and magick. Best example of this, while not something you'll be able to do straight away, is walking in to a shop of the opposite alignment your skills are at. Say you were a whizz-bang technologist and you walk into a magick shop. Just trying to talk to the shop owner will have them scream at you to get out! It's unique and fun! Just having your first companion with you as you master your schematics and degrees, then getting attacked and mortally wounded, and him trying to heal you with spells, only to have them fizzle out uselessly as you are too technically inclined.

It's a fascinating concept I've yet to see implemented in any other game.

Further about the build mechanics. Not only do you have your race and gender, as well as your standard good vs evil alignment once you start playing, but there are some backgrounds to choose from as well that can further define your character. Most of these are just stat re-balances, +4 here and -1, -1, -2 elsewhere, but there are one or two that can be useful for certain play styles.

Still further, there are a range of skills, spells and technical disciplines you can learn. While high tech aptitude doesn't really have much bonuses, higher magick aptitude can elicit greater stats on magickal armour and gear. Such is the nature of the game, you can invest in one, the other, or both, or even neither, should you so choose. You have complete freedom over how you want to play the game.

When I say neither, I speak of the range of skills you can invest in that do not fall under the tech or magick category. Skill points awarded at level up can go into new spells or tech designs, or even something like dodge or melee, pickpocket or detect traps, haggle or persuade, or even firearms or throwing. Some of these are tech, but I can't recall which ones. It's easy enough to check the tech / magick aptitude meter on the right anyway to see what effect they have on your character. Skill points can even go directly into HP or MP, should you so wish.

Entering the world of Arcanum with your character, you will take on a specific main quest that has a little branching depending on your plot choices - the village of Stillwater is perhaps the most affected as you might be expected to wipe it out, which will affect later encounters. If you've ever played Baldur's Gate you'll know what to expect, and clicking to move, as well as turn-based combat, is recommended. Realtime combat is too fast for clicking on enemies, I found. This is especially true if you need to use skills or spells.

One thing I HIGHLY recommend, if you're going down any combat route, is to get up your related skill fast. I was low on skill for far too long before I realised what my problem was, and once I got it higher from a trainer the game got sooo much more enjoyable. 

I'm talking about the early-game problem of the over-abundance of critical misses. 

It can be funny when your weapon flies out of your hand and your stamina bar empties the first time. But when you're just using a basic sword (and we all know how a sword is supposed to swing, right?), it can seem utterly impossible as to how in the world you could have a critical miss so bad that you miss your foe and slice your own neck open. This sort of thing is not uncommon in Arcanum, especially when starting out. Then you get the companion jeers and taunts. You'll be sick of Virgil after a while if you get a bunch of critical misses:

'What in gods... - I mean, better luck next time!' fully voiced as well, setting you up for a very nice epic facepalm.

I don't even want to imagine what would happen if you tried to use something like a pyrotechnic axe, with it's +30 fire damage, without any skill. You'd probably blow up.

More on the story though. It can be a bit unforgiving with clues sometimes as to what you need to do next. There is no going to the map, seeing a waypoint and just instinctively knowing where to go, a lot of it is memory. Even your quest log will only mention people's names - it won't tell you where you found them. I guess in this respect, it's best not to collect quests and let them stagnate. There are a lot of people in the game and a lot of names to remember. But there is enough variety in terms of scenery and what you'll be doing that the game always feels fun and adventurous. The music is not too intrusive either, and the patch I used has an option to disable the combat music.

Sure it has its bugs, but as an older game it is to be expected. As mentioned in the header, there is a patch out there (mentioned in various places, including the forums) that adds a bunch of fixes to the game, but the result of this is a new launcher that isn't part of Steam. It is well worth it. Tech play is made easier with the debug menu (by equipping the ring at the start and talking to Virgil), but I'd still say make sure you pause it if you want to alt tab, as this can crash the game.

Other features of the game include the fate point system, where you can earn fate points for certain tasks or quests, and the legendary Gods quest, where you try to get blessings from all the gods' shrines in the whole game, without making any of the gods angry enough to curse you for doing things in the wrong order. The only problem with this (and sometimes with the game as a whole) is access to certain areas is limited by where you are in the main questline. No one likes finally getting everything only to find yourself at the end of the game with nothing left to do.


In the end, if you're looking for an rpg and you've played everything else, maybe this one will fill your need. There are a lot of builds out there, and there are even forums that discuss some of the weirdest and most outlandish things you can think of.",1,1,0,19,0,2023-02-07,2024-04-22,0,139,434,434

BUT

There's a reason Troika published three games and went bankrupt.
The execution is atrocious.

There are bugs galore, from moronic AI to literally making ranged characters go stand besides the enemies before shooting.
The worst part is the implementation of magick and technology. The story is about how the latter is replacing the first one. That would lead you to believe that, at the very least, technology is as powerful as magick. FALSE! The most powerful character you can build is a wizard. I've played one that had only one level one offensive spell and I completely beat the game without breaking a sweat. Playing a tech character is, basically, setting to game to extra hard mode, specially, if you decide to make a gunslinger (this last one is particularly enfuriating because the intro of the game is a warrior with magick equipment being shot with a pistol).

The easiest way to play this is with a mage or archer/mage, hulksmash build is also very viable. The main campaign is heavy on combat against critters and the most irritating enemies break your gear. You'll be able to switch between real time and turn-based on will to make sure you'll land the most hits. This game is simultaneously awful and good, you can cheese it to the max if you like or play some stunted runt of a character.

NPC: ""Why hello there, fine day isn't it?""
Your responses:
A: ""My good man, it IS quite a fine day old sport""

"A unique squad-based isometric fantasy game, set in a world where technology and magic coexist. The setting is unique, the gameplay will be familiar to any gamer over the age of 40. 

Especially unique is the character creation. Picking your race is pedestrian (human, elf, half elf, half orc). Choosing your back ground is not. Raised by snake handlers. Child of a hero. Ran away with the circus. Your choice will affect your stats. You are given 5 points to use in deciding your skills in combat, thieving, social, or technological skills. With so few points to disperse, you can't be everything. Which adds to replayability.

"[h1]New Review[/h1]
I suddenly got an Arcanum itch and returned to one of the most unique and interesting setting for a CRPG I have still experienced to this day.

This time, instead of following my heart and excitement in creating a technology character like I did in my first playthrough, I went with a magic user (which is actually what many would recommend for their first playthrough).

Why? Because magic is completely broken in this game. The first level of one of the many, MANY different schools of magic unlocks a spell called “Harm”.

It’s literally a first level spell you unlock with just 1 point (that you get every time you level up) and it is quite literally the most powerful spell in the game. I completely cheesed the entire game with this one spell and it felt extremely satisfying.

I then spent another point in learning the unlock spell, which then completely invalidates the lockpicking skill you need to use lockpicks for and level up a maximum of 5 times plus training in order to open locked doors and chests.

It honestly makes playing a technological character feel bad.

As cool as it sounds to be someone who uses a flintlock pistol or rifle, doing so really gimps your character because you have to then constantly pay attention to ammo and purchase them until you’re able to make them. Which takes more level up points, that you also need in order to increase your perception skill to do more damage with said pistols.

But you ALSO need to spend those points in lockpicking as well as spend points into DEX so you can have more action points to spend during your turn in combat… Which is also for the dodge skill so you can not get hit as much. Not to mention if you want actual companions, the amount you can have is dependant on your Charisma skill, so that’s even more points. You need max level (which is 20) in order to be able to have the maximum allowed number of companions.

Not to mention you also need to spend points in the various technological skill trees in order to unlock new schematics to learn.

So as you can see, playing as a technological character, you are at a severe disadvantage on spending your skill points efficiently due to the max level being 50 and you only getting 1 skill point per level up and then occasionally 2 when you hit certain level mile stones.

A mage can use much fewer skill points in doing similar things, which makes playing as one a lot more simpler. 

Hence my newest playthrough being so much more enjoyable to me. I was able to actually be quite comfortable in taking my time and exploring this time around because I didn’t have the stress of having so many different junk items cluttering my inventory in the chance I may need these materials for something to craft.

I just pew-pewed my magic at everything I came across and was able to level up my Charisma to level 20 much earlier on and grab all of the companions I wanted.

This time round, I believe I found and completed most of the quests in the game, I wanted to read all of the books I came across, but unfortunately the graphics and text of the books, while nicely portrayed, was just too blurry and difficult to read.

I only read some books that I felt was important to the story and skimmed the rest in the hope of the game keeping track of what books I’ve “read” in case they matter in some quest or whatever.

This game and its story is still one of my favourites, despite having difficulty in my first playthrough a few years ago, I still managed to enjoy it and I enjoyed it even more the second time round.

I think I’ll come back for a third in another few years and this time play a dumb half-ogre character and bash everything to death.

I would so much love for this game to be given a remaster to make it work better at higher resolutions and modern systems.

The fan patch I used did get it to work, but increasing the resolution past 720p makes the game and its UI much too zoomed out, especially at a 4K resolution.

My first playthrough I played at 1080p on a 1080p screen, this time I played at 720p on a 4K screen and it was actually much better in my opinion.

Posted on 12 Dec, 2022 @ 4:09pm at 46.2 hrs

This was a really good CRPG, the world was very unique with extensive lore and an interesting Victorian/Steampunk fantasy setting.

If I didn't focus almost exclusively on the Main Quest, I reckon I could have spent 80-100+ hours on this game, but unfortunately the aged gameplay mechanics made it so I couldn't enjoy the exploration and side quests enough to take my time with them.

The jank of the pathfinding and lack of formation settings with your companions made me feel too uncomfortable when exploring. Especially since there were many times where my companions would run in and get killed or during turn-based mode their AI or the enemies' would get stuck and I'd have to reload the game.

Despite that though, I really, really enjoyed my time with the game and its story, and I would love to see a sequel some day since it has such an interesting setting. I'm definitely glad I got to play this classic.",1,1,0,0,0,2022-12-12,2025-10-01,1448,222,5741,5741

"Rapide évaluation purement nostalgique :

Ce jeu fait partie de ceux auxquels j'y ai le plus joué (en version CD) durant mon adolescence.
Il a peut-être un peu mal vieillie maintenant, surtout avec les bugs sur la version d'origine sans patchs de la communauté, mais je ne regrette pas les moments passés dessus à m’immerger dans cette univers Steam Punk opposant Magie et Technologie. 
Cette confrontation entre ces deux perceptions de ce monde est tentée d'être expliqué dans l'histoire ainsi que l'origine de toutes les races (surtout si on lit le manuel et les ""mini livres"" du jeu) donnant plus de cohérence.

Comme dit plus haut, le jeu a du vieillir, donc le gameplay rebuterai peut-être certains.
On a le droit a plusieurs choix de dialogue selon nos compétences et caractéristiques qui influencent la fin (sabotée parfois malheureusement par des bugs, mais les patchs communautaires règlent apparemment les soucis).
On peut aussi le jouer au tour par tour, ce qui peut-être pratique dans des situations délicates.

Can't understand people who negatively review old games for having bugs which you can fix with a google search and 5 minutes of your time,1,1,0,4,0,2022-11-24,2022-11-24,158,4,478,25
"A game I have been wanting to play for decades, ever since I had saw an advertised in a PC magazine!  By today's standards the content might be a little rough.  Definitely some sexism and racism thrown into the mix, but in a fantasy setting, so no love for Half-Orcs or Half-Ogres and some races hate Elves or Dwarves, etc.  And men are always going to be stronger and can carry more because of it and deal more melee damage from brute force.  But women can suffer more pain and have better health and have a better resistance to poisoning for instance.

I will say that I have heard negative things due to it being an older game and trying to run it on modern systems.  I am not sure if something was patched in recently, but I can actually play this game on Windows 10.  Normally the game is $6 and quite frankly that is a bargain.  But on sale at only $1.50, it's too precious a deal to ignore.  I normally would not suggest testing the wheels of fate with purchasing just to see if the game works, but if you do not ask for refunds often, I do suggest it for this.  And chances are ""out of the box"" it may work as it did for me.  I did have graphical issues, but they went away on a restart and have not been back since.  And if you do not mind a little tinkering to get it to work, there are 3rd party patches and support for it.

Not a politically correct game as it were..  But you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not play it.  The fantasy aspect of it, with it's mix of Magic and Technology makes a very unique steampunk atmosphere.  Plenty of decisions to be made when creating a character, including options that could severely hinder or assist you.  Plenty of avatars and prebuilt characters as well.  Dialogue trees that effect your play through and so much more.  I do wholeheartedly recommend the game.  And who can pass up on a game with a title like that!?

"Eğer RPG oyunları seviyosanız, özellikle Fallout'un birinci ve ikinci oyununu sevdiyseniz bu oyunu da oynamanızı tavsiye ederim zira bu oyunun arkasında da onlar gibi Tim Cain var. Bu türü seviyorsanız da oyunun çok eski olduğunu hatırlatmak isterim, bu oynanışı vesaire etkiliyor doğal olarak. Aslında oyunu çok çok eskiden oynayıp bitirmiştim. Şimdi bi nostaljiyle Steam'den alıp yeniden oynamak istedim. Oyunun maalesef rehberleri yok denecek kadar az. Bu yüzden Oyuna yeni başlayacak arkadaşlara hatırladığım detaylardan iletmek istediğim birkaç ufak tavsiye var, bu tavsiyelerin en azından yeni öğrenenleri oyunun başında kurtaracağına inanıyorum.
1- terra-arcanum sitesini mutlaka ziyaret edin. Bu oyunun modlarını buradan indirmeniz gerekiyor. Tabii mod dediğimde öyle ekstrem şeyler düşünmeyin. Daha çok gameplayi veya grafikleri düzelten modlar var. Modlu oyun oynamıyorsanız bile high resolution modunu (menüyü değil ama oyunu istediğiniz çözünürlüğe çekmenize yarıyor) ve unofficial patchi indirmenizi tavsiye ederim. Özellikle unofficial patch oynarken karşılacağınız en yaygın bugları temizleyecektir. Bunlar dışında level cap kaldıran modu deneyebilirsiniz zira normalde oyunun 3'te 2'sini falan bitirince level capine ulaşıyorsunuz. Bunların dışında high quality town map modu da gerçekten iyi iş yapıyor.
2- Dövüş sistemini real time kullanmayın. Özellikle yeni başladıysanız real time sistemi oyunu zorlaştırıyor. Bir yandan oyunu çözmeye çalışırken bir yandan o sisteme adapte olmak biraz zorlayabilir. Bunun yerine turn based dövüş sistemine geçerseniz çok çok daha rahat bir oyun geçirirsiniz.
3- Oyunun preset karakterleri çok iyi değil. Kendi karakterinizi yaratmayı deneyin. Cinsiyetlerin ve ırkların artıları ve eksileri olduğunu unutmayın.
4- Karakter yaratırken alacağınız backgroundlara dikkat edin. Bunlar genellikle min-max için veya rp için kullanılan şeyler. Mesela karakterinizin zeka seviyesini gerileten backgroundlar diyalogları komple değiştiriyor. Min-max yapacaksanız ekipman verenler genellikle çok iyi değil. Min-maxlara örnek vermek gerekirse dark sight backgrounduyla beraber prowl + lockpick fulleyip gece her yeri soymaya falan çalışabilirsiniz.
5- Level atlayınca gelen puanlarınızı otomatik olarak kullandırmayın.
6- Melee oynayacaksanız dex önemli, saldırı hızınızı veya turn based oynuyorsanız action pointinizi belirliyor. Hangi türde oynayacaksanız oynayın saldırı için (melee veya throwing) başlangıçta 2 puan vermezseniz starting zone bi tık daha zorlu geçer ama iki puan ayıramıyorsanız bir puanla da kurtarılır. 
7- Karakterinizi yaratırken lockpick mutlaka alın. Yanlış hatırlamıyorsam lockpickleri uzun süre göremeyeceksiniz.
8- Birden fazla save bulundurun. Bazı görev yerlerine gidince yeterince hazır olmadığınızı fark edip save i geriye sarıp ekipman toplayıp dönmeniz gerekecek.
9- Fate puanlarınızı dikkatli harcayın. Bu biraz oyunun çakallığına giriyor ama bazı yerlerde uzun süre alamayacağınız ekipmanları çalmak için kullanabiliyorsunuz.
10- Oyunu cheeselemek istiyorsanız satıcıları kolay soyma yöntemi var. Oyunu geceye sarıyorsunuz. 2 saat daha ilerletip satıcıyı odasına kadar takip ediyorsunuz. Sonra zamanı sabaha sarıyorsunuz. Satıcı odasından çıkınca sandıklarını picklockla açıyorsunuz (spell atmayın çok ses yapıyor). Çok sıkıştığınız bir yerde bu cheese metodunu kullanabilirsiniz. 
11- Karanlıkta dövüşmenin debuffı var. Boş bir eliniz varsa oraya bi lamba falan sıkıştırıp çözebiliyorsunuz. Daha önce verdiğim min-max örneği olan dark sight bufflı thief karakteri ranged oynatıp zindanlardaki ışıkları uzaktan söndürüp çok ciddi avantaj elde edebilirsiniz.
12- Karakterinize her şeyi yaptırmaya çalışmayın. Evet, karakteriniz birden fazla şey yapabilecek duruma geliyor ama her şeyi de yapmaya çalışırsanız çok fazla eksisini görürsünüz.

Umarım oyundan keyif alırsınız. Yanlış hatırladığım bir nokta varsa düzeltmekten çekinmeyin",1,1,0,8,0,2022-11-17,2022-11-17,0,6,81,71

"Я всегда гордился, что родился в золотой век ААА гейминга и могу наслаждаться такими шедеврами как AC:Odyssey, пока наши деды играли в пиксели на экране. Но та сторона предков манила меня, всегда было прикольно слышать про  старые игры 1900 года. Поэтому время от времени, я достаю из библиотеки игры которые застали русско-французскую войну. Я получил огромнейшее удовольствие от прохождения Fallouta, но разочаровался Baldurs Gate'ем. Из-за чего долго пытался пересилить себя, чтобы начать Arcanum. 
И игра оказалась шедевральной , во-первых игра в которой можно поиметь овцу, априори не может быть плохой. Во-вторых в игре не смотря на свой возраст, огромное количество годноты - балдежный сюжет с твистами.
Лор познается легко и не принужденно, и просто играя ты уже шаришь за вселенную, в отличии от BG - который давался мне тяжело.
Сайды супер годные от подай принеси до расследований и экзорцизма, разборок банд и смену власти, и тайных заговоров.
Боевка пошаговая - но можно врубать быстрый режим и в принципе легкие мобы скипаются сразу.
Минусами для меня оказалось только проблемы с игрой, пока пропатчишь, накатишь руссик, все несколько раз сломается, то из-за большого фпс, то игра просто будет в 2 фпс,  то в игре будет не хватать файлов. Которые надо искать по форумам -  где с 2007 года никого не было. Но если это преодолеть, то не пожалеешь игра того стоит.
Но и второй момент наверное  - данжи, так как после нескольких пещер и канализаций , где толпы мобов и все сделано лабиринтами  и все одинаковое, то очень легко задушиться.
Сеттинг конечно компенсирует все сполна, супер балдежный стимпанк+фентези. В ниче подобное наверное и не играл никогда, на ум на данный момент ничего не приходит

"Very clunky, and very clearly a product of the 90's (despite having been released in 2001). Graphics comparable to the first two Fallout games. Also, it's buggy as hell, even with the unofficial fan patch. 

But...

Like the first two Fallout games- also developed by some of the people who worked on this game- it is an absolute gem of a CRPG. Brilliant worldbuilding, a gripping story, very open-ended gameplay for a game of its era, fantastic voice acting (when there is any), and a very fleshed out character creation and progression system.

Cannot stress this enough; if you love RPGs, buy this game. If you're a Fallout fan, this game is a must-play. Just go in with the expectation that it will be a very steep learning curve unless you grew up (or have invested a lot of time) playing these sort of games; and that this game isn't exactly the most polished in the medium. 8/10, cheap as hell, but worth far more than the price tag would suggest.",1,1,0,2,0,2022-10-16,2022-10-16,421,96,410,227

"How did I not hear about this game 20 years ago? For me, where I have played 100's of RPGs since the 90's when I started gaming,discovering this game was like a combination of finding a missing link in the evolution of gaming and stumbling into an alternate universe where the makers of one of my favorite games, Fallout 2, released a game that surpassed even that.

Here you'll find a massive open world, an original take on the classic fantasy races and their interactions with each other, an amount of content and enough variation in play styles, such as the magic vs. technology dichotomy, to keep you busy for dozens if not 100's of hours, and plots that will keep you entertained and trying to guess what's coming next. While its easy to see why this game, with its complex systems and thoughtful themes, didn't top the best selling lists at the time, it really is a tragedy that this game's sales went as poorly as they did because there was greatness here and a potential for more in the form of sequels that expanded on the world and lore. 

If you're like me and have played through and loved all of the classic RPGs, from Fallout to Baldur's Gate 2, Dark Souls to Divinity Original Sin 2, and so on, but somehow missed out on Arcanum, this is like finding a long lost season of your favorite TV show. If that sounds like you at all, you missed out on playing this game when it was released AND you are somehow reading this review, don't make the same mistake again.

"Ignore the play time, Steam didn't track it properly (possibly because of the multiverse patch?). I don't actually now how long I've played for, but it was a decent amount (not to mention playing a lot when it first game out).

I've gone back and forth whether to recommend it or not. Ultimately, I feel it's too dated with too many issues.

There's a variety of ways to play (tech, magic, melee/dodge) and races which have variety, but I feel like despite it being a world where tech is overcoming magic, magic is far superior. You only need to worry about getting your magic aptitude to 100 for good damage (which takes about 20 spells with 0 starting aptitude and no tech) and it is just so much simpler.  Most of the good stuff already seemed to be magical in nature, you get teleportation for travel almost everywhere (vs the more limited trains), you have disintigrate for the stronger foes and things like Harm for the ones that damage your stuff when attacked (like Ore Golems).  Tech needs to find manuals to build a lot of stuff and if you want to use say guns, you need to constantly get bullets.

I found the story to be lackluster and barely there - it felt like I spent more time wandering around compared to the story moving on and this wasn't even doing side quests - this was actual story areas where just nothing really happened much.  For the most part, the companions were just there.  Only Virgil really had anything to say and it was mostly towards the end.  Magnus had stuff to say if you do the quest to find the Iron Clan, but I don't think I heard much from my other companions (dog, Sogg, and Chukka).  I don't know if it was a bug or not, but when I finally beat the final boss, the game just seemed to end and the implication was that I failed? (I'm hard of hearing so it was hard to tell, but there was a pretty desolate looking picture and i think it did say Arcanum was destroyed even though I stopped the boss?

I had mastery in Persuasion, a really good alignment, high INT, high Beauty, and made it clear i didn't agree with the final boss so I have no idea what went wrong.  This is really annoying to me as i usually like to play more Diplomatic characters to complete as many quests as possible and do it peacefully, but it felt pointless here as it seemed very rare that I even needed Persuasion.

I also encountered a bunch of issues despite having the multiverse edition despite it including the most updated version of the unofficial patch (2.2.1 or something).  I experienced crashes every so often - not too bad, but then I got like 3 or 4 in the final dungeon alone.  Some of the quests bugged for me as well.  An example is I couldn't do Stringy Pete's quests to get his boat to get to the final areas.  I could return the treasure fine, but the others wouldn't complete. At least, the third one wouldn't.  The second task to fix an altar worked after reloading the older save worked, but the third task to destroy a sword in forge that was literally right next to it never worked.  I put the sword in, it would be destroyed, and nothing.  Thank Goodness Disintegrate works on Stringy Pete as I didn't care for what is supposed to be the hardest fight in the game...",0,1,0,6,0,2022-08-18,2022-08-18,1281,83,27,27

"Quizas uno de los juegos mas increibles que jugué en mi vida. A pesar de todo lo que tiene en contra, sigue siendo el juego que recordamos en mi grupo de amigos.
Puedo dedicar parrafos al apartado tecnico y la jugabilidad, pero resumiendo: no es un juego lindo visualmente (y no lo era cuando salió) pero el mundo que plantea hace que todo sea atractivo. 
Es un mundo diferente... steampunk en algunos aspectos... Vivir una especie de edad industrial y su impacto en un mundo fantástico te atrapa, aunque quizas la historia es un poco cliché en algunos aspectos. Sin embargo esta tan lleno de momentos y lugares memorables.

Tiene cosas de fallout (y fallout tactics), el combate se puede configurar para funcionar en tiempo real (diferente al de la saga Baldurs Gate) o en combate por turnos, con un sistema de puntos de accion.

EL personaje tiene un medidor de Moral (de bueno a malo) que afecta la relacion con compañeros de grupo y el mundo en general.... De igual manera tiene un medidor de inclinacion hacia la magia o hacia la ciencia. Esto ayuda a acentuar que en el mundo del juego la magia y la tecnologia se contraponen.

Hacer un personaje es bastante intuitivo y no es un juego muy dificil ya que todo tiene cierta lógica. Por ejemplo: el valor de PERCEPCION del personaje determina todo lo relativo al combate a distancia y si lo acrecentamos las granadas que lancemos serán mas precisas (tb afecta disparos y otras cosas...). Un personaje sin percepcion no suele lanzar los objetos exacto al lugar donde le indicamos..
Todo funciona de forma ""entendible"" si lo comparamos con otros juegos de este tipo y no recuerdo haber necesitado demasiado la ayuda de guias.
Otros valores del personaje nos dicen cuantos hechizos podemos mantener activos, qué nivel de hechizo podemos aprender (HAY 19 ESCUELAS DE MAGIA con hechizos exclusivos a cada una....), qué tan rapido nos recuperamos y cuanto resistimos al veneno, cuanto peso podemos cargar, etc... todo es bastante logico...
Lo mejor de todo es que un personaje inteligente tendra más y mejores respuestas en dialogo que un personaje tonto. De igual manera, un personaje carismatico tendra otras opciones de dialogo y podrá reclutar mas compañeros. 
Todo tiene mucho impacto y esto permite jugar el juego de maneras REALMENTE variadas segun el personaje.

Los personajes con afinidad tecnologica podran fabricar explosivos, municion, autómatas... Es posible especializarse en ramas como la herboristeria para crear mejores pociones y antidotos. 

ES UN JUEGO MEMORABLE, a veces hermoso, a veces feo visualmente, siempre encantador. con un sistema de combate un poco ""rústico"" pero ágil que incita a jugar el mismo combate varias veces hasta obtener un resultado deseado. 
Los compañeros son geniales, en especial Virgil que nos acompaña toda la aventura (si asi lo deseamos).

Creating your character is the hardest part of the game. Once you get past FOMO of tech vs Magic and you just go for something the game is amazing. I have a couple save files because it keeps getting corrupted. Wish someone would remake this or expand on this game. I haven't played it since I was a kid and its just as good.

"I originally got this game from my new step-dad, over 10 years ago, around the age of 12. It was on a CD, in a box, with a printed game guide, included. It didn't require a game-client login, nor an internet connection to play, and it was pretty much one of the only things my poor 2 gb ram, refurbished home and office laptop could handle. It was one of the first RPGs I had ever played, and one of the first willingly given to me, since all I could get beforehand were random CD games given to Goodwill that I prayed worked and didn't need internet connection when I got home. 

I was a baby gamer, I loved video games, wanted to play video games, but knew nothing about them, and had never played anything ""big"" besides Pokemon, because I was a little girl raised on a farm in the deep south. I didn't know what a ""Triple A"" game was, I didn't have internet connection, and I sure has hell hadn't played anything like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or even Fable.

But let me tell you, I LOVE this game. I poured hours into this game, and it kick-started everything I love about RPGs. Some of my fondest gaming memories are in this game, even when my character was led to a room with a sheep in it by the hostess of a brothel when asked if your tastes are ""Unique"".  Nowadays, I feel like I'm quite knowledgeable about gaming and even have a decent gaming setup, and dabble in gaming journalism. It opened the door to other games, and eventually an interest in game dev (which didn't go anywhere), and now I'm a programmer in my day job. Once I moved on to Elder Scrolls, I found myself having a hard time playing isometric, ""classic"" RPGs, but once I saw this game was on Steam (I had already moved out and lost the CD by this point), memories unlocked, tears came to my eyes, and I instantly bought it and downloaded it. 

It's a quick download, since it is a relatively small game compared to most these days, despite the amount of content. I opened it and... spent 2 hours trying to get to the first city. I didn't remember it being this difficult. How did tween me just click with it immediately? But over time, things came back to me, I got into the flow of things, but with a more matured and experienced RPG-player mindset, and I just.. enjoyed it. I didn't care it was isometric. I didn't care it was from 2001. I was immersed in an amazingly developed fantasy/steampunk world where I can truly do anything. I wasn't me, I was a halfling trying to make friends and juggle responsibilities while exploring this fantastic world, trying to navigate this adventure I was unwillingly thrusted into by getting into the wrong zeppelin.  You know, the ""true"" purpose and experience aimed for by RPGs, originally. 

Okay, onto an actual review instead a recipe blog post: I recommend this game, but understand what you're getting.

1. This is an early-2000s RPG. It dates itself. It is difficult. It can seem overwhelming at first, but once you get into the swing of things, it feels a lot smoother and better.

2. You can truly play the game however you want. There is no such thing as an ""essential"" NPC. You can beat the game by killing everyone. NPCs that had ""essential"" information for you will have that info on a note in their pocket on their body. It's quite a bit harder, but if you play your cards right, you can even beat the game by killing no one. 

3. Your actions have actual consquences. Remember this. 

4. There are adult moments in this game, parents. No explicit scenes, but there is a brothel. And in that brothel is a sheep room. Take that what you will.

5. Very nice character creation with a variety of races, classes, and backgrounds. Think Baldur's Gate. 

6. So many companions. But the companions are actually complex and can leave you.

7. The quadrant system is interesting, if a bit complex. So you be more compatible with magick or you can be more compatible with technology (the steamworks part of this). There is a slider and it adjusts accordingly to your actions and skills you use. You can also be ""good"" or ""evil"" and the slider adjusts accordingly. These can affect how your character is treated, and even if certain NPCs are willing to be companions or not. You can not be both for either. 

8. I did not encounter any bugs, but that does not mean there isn't any.

9. Inventory management can be annoying, since it's based on geometry and not weight. 

10. I one day hope for a re-master or even a re-make.",1,1,0,44,0,2022-05-27,2022-05-27,220,7,202,40

"Classic isometric RPG from the now-defunct Troika Games. This game has a unigue premise, in that it takes place in a fantasy world with all the traditional Tolkien-esque races (Elves, Dwarves, Humans etc.), but with the added detail that this world has recently entered an industrial revolution much like our own. Much like our own industrial revolution, this adds all kinds of advancements and troubles of its own. The magic that exists in this world has a negative effect on any technology operating in the area, and vice-versa, Would highly recommend that you give this game a try, with a few caveats. The unofficial patch should definitely be installed, it's basically required. This fixes various bugs that remained in the game after release. It also let's the game run in modern resolutions without stretching the visuals unnaturally.
Second caveat, I highly recommend you play the game with turn-based combat enabled. Not doing so makes certain play styles almost impossible. All in all, a highly recommended game. Hopefully now that Activision is owned (or will soon be owned) by Microsoft, the possibility exists that we may get a sequel.
Some negatives. The UI can be difficult to navigate at times. Also, it can be easy to create a character that is almost impossible to play with if you are not careful. The visuals can, and probably will put most people off of playing the game.
The positives: The music is unique and fits the game and the world itself perfectly. The story is reasonably interesting and the world-building is great.",1,1,0,4,0,2022-05-16,2022-06-15,357,20,656,650

"It's a great RPG, but not a perfect one by a long shot, this is what Tim Cain went on to make after leaving interplay, sometime after fallout. Best part of this one is its industrialized fantasy setting, meaning it's a little bit steampunk, and a little bit Lord of the Rings. 

Magic and Technology have a balance, and when that balance is tipped in one way, the other suffers. In an Industrialized City magic will often fail, but in a more magically dominated area machines are prone to malfunction.

The amount of bugs prevent this from being perfect, you can boundary break because the game procedurally generates the world so that you can literally manually walk to any location in the game, if you switch between manually moving and using the map screen there are quite a few spots in the map you will eventually force your way through the shorelines and literally walk on the ocean to skip most of the game.

Combat feels clunky, they designed it in 3 modes(set in options), and none of them really work all that great, real time makes ranged enemies able to fling a hundred arrows/bullets at once, so just don't use that one.",1,0,0,0,0,2022-05-07,2022-05-07,205,17,1158,559

Even though it did not age well in terms of gameplay and mechanics (as old school CRPGs very rarely do), it's a bit hard to make it work properly since it wasn't remastered for today's computers. But it's an experience that's definitely worth the effort. This game is a cult classic that must be played by anyone who's invested in RPGs.",1,1,0,13,0,2022-05-04,2022-05-04,885,59,1262,1262

And here's a guide that can walk you through [url=https://youtu.be/pKgvwCiAmac]necessary and helpful GAME FIXES for modern systems! [/url]

The struggles between the forces of magick and tech, the juxtaposition of steam and sword, and the morally gray choices presented to the player at every turn help make Arcanum a memorable cult classic that should be enjoyed by all fans of good reading and great worldbuilding. It’s flawed and messy at times, but also beautiful, funny, engaging, and enraging at others.

A lot of the same team behind Fallout 1/2 helped bring Arcanum to life. While Fallout endeared its fans with cutesy cartoon characters, nuclear annihilation, and 50s retrofuturism, Arcanum shifts its focus to gentlemanly language, flintlock pistols, and locomotives. 

Fallout's through-lines of player agency and enormous roleplaying potential are even stronger in this steampunk pseudo-sequel. A massive game, a forgotten classic, a must-play for fans of oldschool RPGs that still holds up today.",1,0,0,4,0,2022-04-01,2022-04-01,0,111,40,40

"There some old games that stand the test of time, but I don't think this is one of those. I'd only recommend if you have nostalgia for this game, or if you really like old games in general. I like the idea of the world/lore, and I can ignore the old graphics, but the game mechanics are pretty bad in my opinion. The game play seems a bit overly complex but also too simple in certain respects. Upgrade points apply to both attributes and skills, so you'll likely need to look at the skills you want and only upgrade attribute points so that you can use those skills, is the aim I guess. If you want to go for a ranged build, you'll need to dump quite a bit into it starting out, otherwise it's not very viable. I originally tried going for a gun focused character but only selected one point in guns, found out that means you only have 30% chance to hit which is just pointless really. The AI is pretty dumb and will just go straight after your main character, even if you have party members in between. So this game will likely favor melee builds. Trying a ranged build I had to run around quite a bit till I got lucky and the party member finally hit, which would often get the enemies focus. Final straw for me was this mechanic where my character just fell to the ground with fatigue and stayed down for the whole battle. Figured out after some time it was likely as my mana (fatigue?) bar was getting drained, there's no logs to show for sure it seems. I'll probably give it another try as it's a bit of a challenge now for me to figure out  a good build, but I don't think most people would generally like this. I'd recommend if your into techno-fantasy, probably best to look into the Shadowrun series.",0,1,0,0,0,2022-02-13,2022-02-13,0,73,437,343

Бои здесь жутковатые, карта просто ахтунг, навигация сосед, как закрыть окно подбора я так и не понял - первый Esc это выход в меню, второй Esc выход обратно в игру - так только и выходил. 
Почему даже в самом начале меня убили какие-то крысы в бою в пещере???  Причем я создал амбала орка качка с силой 16 и интеллектом 1.

"This one is quite old, but solid oldschool steampunk RPG.

It isn't as famous as ""Fallout"" series (Sadly), but it has similar fight mechanics than first 2 parts of that series. But here in arcanum, you can change it to the real-time/tactical modes and settings are quite different. The game itself is a hidden gem and you can play it on your gramma's toaster and replay it several times again... It will still be fun.

To keep the story short [b](Spoilers Alert):[/b]

[spoiler]There was peace among all the creatures of Arcanum. Dwarf used advanced tech in their underground castles, elfs had ruled over them magical woods. Humans, used to mind their own business and bulds capitalism&stuff in the outside world... Untill some dwarf picked up a orphan human boy and taught him about dwarwen inventions. Eventually, that got him kicked out of the clan and the boy had become an inventor of steam machines in human society, which lead to an industrial boom... Disturbing the powers of magic, which made elfs and other magical creatures quite unhappy and started a conflict between tech and magic. And after that point, starts the story of the game from protagonist's perspective, you choose how it ends. Keep in mind that your decisions do matter and there are several endings.[/spoiler]

It's an old masterpiece. Good music, ambient, game mechanics... A lot of tactical options to choose from, plenty of texted dialogs, different random quests and a whole steampunk fantasy world to explore. The only bad thing so far, is that since the game is old... It's not that friendly with steam interface.

"I have played Arcanum from the disks, GOG Galaxy, Steam, and some of the other mediums they offered since the game launched. It definitely has its issues, and the game once you master it gets really, really easy overall. There are choices that effect the total outcome and you can roleplay as any type of character your heart desires. Playing as a melee/dodge with high strength character puts the game on easy mode, and other players will tell you that tech trees are shit, etc... But honestly I have easily beat the game playing every possible discipline with all sorts of various followers. Make sure you download the UAP, there are instructions on the community hub as it just fixes a lot of the game. I hope you enjoy Arcanum, as it is honestly one of the best older games around. Also if you like this style, the folks who made this are working on another steakmpunk style game and their studio was one of those that got bought out by Microsoft...so who knows.",1,1,0,9,0,2022-01-30,2022-01-30,0,4,3115,2857

"Играя в Арканум я часто замечал то что в своё время над ним работали больше чем над Фоллаут. Начиная от системы боя и повествования, он многим отличается от своего старшего брата. Арканум одна из моих любимых игр в жанре фэнтези. После прохождения Арканум я стал замечать что фильмы, книги и другие игры на этот жанр мне кажутся банальными и не особо интересными, просто в Аркануме затрагиваются очень серьёзные темы: неравенство рас и полов, расизм, шовинизм и другие вещи, и из-за этого мир Арканум кажется живым, а не фасадом про спасение мира и героизм. Арканум затрагивает те аспекты, которые другие фентези не трогают, этим он и кажется живым и цельным.",1,1,0,1,0,2022-01-20,2023-01-05,563,14,174,174

"Uhhh, I am going to be dating myself here a little bit.  I was still in high school when Arcanum came out and loved it!  So when it became available on steam I jumped at the chance, mainly to see what the community would come up with for it and I was not disappointed.  Arcanum is a game with a whole lot of quests that lead to other quests, but with little or no information to lead to the completion of some of those quests.  In a word, going in blind you will be completely lost for a long time.  Save OFTEN!  You will make decisions and then people will attack you and wind up being like, ""What the hell just happen?""  This is mainly due to your ever changing character sheet depending on what you learn, actions you take, blessings, curses, being the hero of towns; so much will be effecting what you do if you play straight.  What this means?  it is difficult, but fun.  You rarely experience the same game twice.  Yes, the outcomes are limited, but I for one do not play games for the ending, but the journey.  You can be a human gun slinger one run, a dwarven archer the next, maybe a half-ogre wizard.  At the time of this writing I only have 5 steam hours into the game and playing straight have made it to three towns.  There is about 10 towns in the game and hundreds of hours of possible game play.  The UI is pagey and the fighting is basic slashy.  The sound effects for the weapons and magic and really good with the gun fire and bow work.  Not really able to use controller control and driven by point and click.  You have to have a good plan on what you want to run because skill points to use on your character can be hard to come by in the later part of the game and just from practical skills there are 16 skill sets.  That does not count the magic, tech tree, physical attributes, and health/mana increases.  If you are a fan of old fashion character buffs management, equipment and inventory control, and follower progression; you will love it.",1,1,0,0,0,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,0,6,878,329

"Troika has build a very unique, compelling & story-rich world, a fantasy land called ""Arcanum"" in which magic & technology barely coexist together, this world which is obviously highly inspired by 19th century England during the Industrial revolution, is filled to the brim with interesting lore, dialogue, characters & locations to explore. 

It has very high replay value due to the nearly innumerable ways to customize ones character & build. I personally don't mind the combat mechanics either, my recommendation is to keep it on real-time & only change to turn-based if the enemies are either too hard or too plenty (or both). 
The voice acting is also excellent & the soundtrack is absolutely magnificent. 

I would consider ""Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura"" to be one the best RPG's of all time, ""Top 5"" for sure.",1,1,0,2,0,2022-01-02,2023-01-22,0,42,13380,11454

"Sorti à l'époque des Fallout 1&2, Arcanum n'avait pas fait énormément de bruit, et pourtant...

Vingt ans plus tard, et même si on sent qu'il est techniquement un peu daté (graphisme, ergonomie...), on se rend compte que c'est un jeu qui reste fondamentalement très sain et très bon. 

Déjà, univers steampunk, pas hyper commun. Ensuite, la liberté pour créer son personnage, pour explorer le monde et gérer ses quêtes comme on l'entend. Et surtout, le fait que selon qu'on joue un personnage mage ou technologiste, un personnage bon ou mauvais, un bagarreur ou un habile négociateur, le jeu offrira une expérience très sensiblement différente. Par exemple, l'histoire change totalement avec l'alignement. Par exemple, [spoiler]on peut vaincre le dernier boss sans combattre ; uniquement par le dialogue.[/spoiler]

Synopsis: 
If there was ever a game that needed a sequel - this would be it. A love child created from past Fallout employees - this is easily a top 10 RPG for me. You get near limitless freedom with how you want to create your character and there are several factors in the development that will have lasting affects on the game. Want to have a magick vs technology focused character? Good versus Evil? Solo or an army of followers? The game leaves it all up to you. The story is great and the character interactions can be sad, uplifting or even down right hilarious. If you are an RPG fan in any capacity you owe it to yourself to buy this game.

"I've played this a lot more than 8 hours, used to have a retail copy. Lost the disc, lost the hard-drive, bought it here and on GoG. If you like a Fallout 1 or 2 style cRPG, this'll be up your alley. It's a steampunk-esque high fantasy setting. 

First of all, you may need to do some things before running the game. There are guides to help you with this, but don't expect steam over-lay to work as a result. However, imo, this gem is worth the effort.

There are numerous ways to play the game and build your character. Want to be a gunslinger half-Ogre that's only smart at one thing and dumb about others? You can.

Want to be a wizard halfling that is a trust-fund baby? You can.

Want to be an elven merchant who has a mysterious past? That's also in the cards.

The character customizability isn't to be scoffed at, granted it's not as in depth as, say, Pathfinder: WOTR, but it's deep in its own right, there's just a bit more role-playing you have to do that's not hardcoded into your character. 

The graphics are in line with what you'd expect from Fallout 1 and 2 and Diablo 2. The story, however, isn't. It's its own and, imo, is compelling. I would say it's on a level below Planescape: Torment, which isn't a bad place to be at all. The game is sandboxy so, you can absolutely get the intro quests out of the way and then focus solely on everything else BUT the main story. 

The sound is excellent imo. The soundtrack especially. It give you this early industrial revolution circa 1800's feel and is quality. There's a mix of spoken and written dialog, of the spoken dialog the voice actors did very well imo, the writing itself is fantastic. It reminds me of Morrowind except more coherent. 

My only gripe about the game is the issues I had running it. It needs some severe QOL updates so that it's playable straight out of the box instead of having to much around with various PC settings. I saw SsethTzeentach's review mention that you have to run the game in safe-mode. I didn't have to do that, but I did have to use a shortcut to the exe itself that had a command line that allowed the game to run without steam, which is why I said that there's no overlay. Once I remember the steps I had to take to get things up and running I'll update this guide. 

The story has a mix of linear and non-linear where some things occur differently depending on how you play them, while others are your standard ""I can kill just about everyone but the critical NPC's and still get this part of the story"". 

If you like classic cRPG's and want a steampunk spin on it, this game is for you.",1,1,0,3,0,2021-11-25,2021-11-25,0,68,516,514
"Perfect example of a diamond in the rough. Definitely shows its age with some missing QoL features and even with fan patches this is super buggy, but it also manages to excel in many ways. Fantastic voice acting along with a charming orchestral soundtrack help elevate its presentation, and mechanically a lot of variety is offered with the combat and your characters background, with many unique and fun presets that can drastically change your game. Depending on your build you may have trouble with some fights, but luckily you can rely on companions to do most of the work if you dump a bunch of points into charisma. Combat aside there's still lots to like here with interesting varied quests that offer loads of different approaches and outcomes.

Admittedly my tolerance for jank is quite high but this is honestly a lot better than I was expecting, and a decent remaster would probably have people talking about this in the same regard as something like Planescape.",1,1,0,3,1,2021-11-24,2021-11-24,869,31,3244,1266

"A classic broken masterpiece from the departed Troika studios. The best steampunk isometric RPG's I've seen thus far. Has it's share of issues, but if you can see past that at the world building and story is well worth the play.",1,1,0,0,0,2021-11-18,2021-11-18,0,3,762,543
"Классика ролевой игры! Всем советую, хоть и графон сейчас и не очень воспринимается, но сюжеты квестов хотел сказать шикарные, но вовремя остановился, сюжеты строго хорошие, а возможности в них многообразны, что квесты - очень интересны и рекомендуются к прохождению! И да, механика магии и технологии в игре на момент запуска воспринималась очень и очень интересна, жаль что подобного пока еще не встречал, если что посоветуйте, что за игры я пропустил с такой механикой =)
Музыка в игре до сих пор мурашки по коже от саундтрека к игре, иногда отдельно переслушиваю.
Ну и в качестве бонуса. Игра захватила меня сразу, музыка, сюжет, но самое первое, что захватило мое внимание - заставочная сцена, где рыцарь убивает врага из револьвера. Такая смесь магии и технологии просто шикарна, я все еще надеюсь, что когда-нибудь создатели Тирани, Паффайндера, Невервинтера и Балдерсгейта обратят внимание на данную вселенную и сделают обновленную или вторую часть этой игры!!!",1,1,0,0,1,2021-11-15,2021-11-15,0,18,1135,1134

"One of the greatest RPGs of all time.
In what other game can you play as a machine gun-wielding, tuxedo/magnetized top hat-wearing Half-Orc who instigates an Anarchist worker uprising against the racist, eugenicist, capitalist bourgeoisie industrialists who govern London (Tarant) and the rest of its constituent UK (Unified - not United - Kingdom) polities? In what other game can you play as a Dwarf committing genocide against the Elves with mechanized armor and a grenade launcher; or, on the flip-side, as an Elf who commits genocide against the Dwarves by summoning an army of demon rabbits? Those are just a few of the numerous possibilities that you may pursue, should you so desire.
Despite Arcanum being two decades old at this point, there are still few other RPGs that manage to reach the same level of making the player feel like a real part of the world.
For the best vanilla experience I recommend at least playing with the following mods: Multiverse Edition (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760410053) with Sir Expectations Mod Pack enabled, as it provides much appreciated rebalancing, as well as the mod that makes ammo (bullets, arrows, batteries, fuel) weightless (labelled ""ammo.zip"" here: https://terra-arcanum.com/forums/threads/latest-uap-vs-other-hacks-patches-etc-etc.23016/).

"It's a game that I have a huge nostalgia-bias towards. A 14 year old me, playing this inbetween tests and highschool drama. It will always have a huge weight and place for me, a Lord Of The Rings like adventure, with fellowship, wonder, nestled in a twisted conflict between Magic and Technology. Characters will have philosophical debates, quests will make you question your own prejudices and even racial tensions in a fantasy veneer are brought up, going further than the meme ""Elf vs dwarf"" conflict - a topic criminally underused in today's RPG games (albeit understandable, considering political implications). If you want to experience a game from a time where political correctness didn't stifle every new release, you will get a brutally honest experience.",1,1,0,6,0,2021-11-10,2021-11-10,2837,281,7464,858

there are official and unofficial patches you need to make it not crash on you. even then, it's still a little buggy.
but, it's one of the best rpg's out there...the story is great, the characters are fun and varied, and it has i think the most unique rpg character system.....you choose either tech or magic....the replayability isn't necessarily endless, but i've had a great time building 4 very different characters, and assembling 4 different teams of follwers, and making different decisions in the game so every quest isn't the same.....there's multiple ways to accomplish most things you just have to think a little about it...

"6/10

Positiv:
- Story und Quests sind ok.
- Vielfältige Möglichkeiten, sich auszutoben: Als Dieb, Mechaniker, Kämpfer, Magier, Alchimist.
- Als Gut oder Böse. Mit Rufsystem.
- Dazu ausgefeilte Skilltrees.
- Möglichkeit, Kämpfe wahlweise in Echtzeit oder rundenbasiert zu schlagen.
- Mehrere Lösungsmöglichkeiten für Quests.
- Viele Handlungen haben Konsequenzen im Spielverlauf. Dies ist von den Machern recht gut durchdacht.
- Guter Preis. Keinesfalls die Hinweise im Forum zum Patchen übersehen!

Negativ:
- Stürzt oft ab. Speichern nicht vergessen!
- Der Umstand, dass man im Kampf oder durch Fallen seine Waffe verlieren kann und dies zu spät bemerkt und sie dann verloren ist, kann extrem frustrierend sein.
- Sehr ungleich verteilter Loot. Gegner lassen kaum interessante Items fallen. Dann plötzlich sind einzelne Kisten so randvoll mit guten Sachen, dass man gar nicht weiß, wohin damit. Und es ist immer eine derselben vorgefertigten Kompositionen von special Loot. Sehr selten hat man Unique Items. Irgendwann erkennt man schon vorm Identifizieren, welche Waffe oder Rüstung es ist und ob es sich lohnt, das mitzuschleppen denn..
- ... oft ist es sehr schwer, seinen Kram loszuwerden, da die Geldbörse von Händlern begrenzt ist und sich erst mit der Zeit wieder auffüllt. Und ohne Skills kauft nicht jeder Händler alles.
- Bis auf wichtige Maps ist der Großteil der Spielkarte leer. Klar ist es so gewollt, dass man zwischen diesen Orten die Schnellreisefunktion benutzt. Aber irgendwie hätte man das nicht sooo auswalzen müssen mit den Entfernungen und ab und an ein paar Gegner platzieren können. Stattdessen kann es dann plötzlich sein, dass man während der Schnellreise von einer ganzen Horde von Feinden überfallen wird, bei deren Abschlachten man mal eben 2 Levels aufsteigt, während man dafür mit den Quests in den Siedlungen viel länger braucht. Schon etwas unausgewogen.
- Etwas schade ist, dass nicht mal die Texte in deutscher Sprache vorliegen. Ich kenne das Spiel erst seit Steam. Aber wenn ich anderen Quellen glauben darf, gabs früher eine deutsche Version.

"A classic CRPG with an incredible atmosphere. In a beautiful steampunk/fantasy world with great artwork and amazing violin music, that is melancholic and fits the mood well. Complete the game however you want, this game has very great RP opportunities. If you want to play a complete pacifist, that is okay! You can your way out of most situations in the game, including the ends boss. While the world is beautiful, it is kind of empty and too big. Traveling takes time, even though there is a waypoint system in the overworld as well as in the location map. People complain about combat, but I don't see an issue with it at all. It can be hard at times and being a mage with the first Necromantic Black spell is very OP.

On a serious note, this game does role playing better than any other game in the world, personally. The setting really gives you a feel for your place in the world.

"A great classic with an amazing character advancement system. Be sure to look up how to increase performance under Windows 10, as it uses DirectX 7 (emulated badly in Win10). The best ddirectx.dll implementation comes from Wine.",1,1,0,0,0,2021-09-30,2021-09-30,0,10,2014,183
"Hum... Nope. This is an RPG/adventure game. It's a mix of Steampunk and fantasy. The graphics are old and dated. The music is decent. The story might be good but it takes a while to develop, so who knows?

No bugs or crashes. Works fine on Win 7.

Let's see. If you played the first two Fallouts you can get the idea behind this game. A huge map with lots of quests. Plenty fighting. This game will allow you to use technology and/or magic to solve stuff. The crafting system is big and complex, you gonna need to collect a lot of junk along the way. Looks fun? Nah. This game is not Fallout, not even close. This game is a chore. Everything takes forever. There's no real progression, many early quests will require the character to be way more powerful to solve them, so you gonna be running around, and that's a boring chore in itself, looking for quests that you can actually solve. 

The combat is unsatisfactory, to say the least. The RPGaming is deep, but also way too complex and slow, really slow, turtle slow. There're many things unexplained or partially explained. You do need to read the manual, but the manual is the same as the game, weird and tiresome to read. All in this game is designed to take a long time. You can sink a couple of hours playing and not advancing a bit in the quest at hand even if, as said before, turns out you can solve it at all at your current level. So this game is a true time-hog... but doesn't feel rewarding. 

So, It's old, dated, complex, a chore, slow-paced, not too interesting, and the design and direction are nothing to brag about. The idea is good but the implementation is mediocre. This is a very, very niche game. There's a public for this, sure, but I will venture the presumption that those are not legion. As usual, beware of feedback that comes from nostalgia. Don't overpay for this if you want to give it a try, you'll probably gonna ditch it unfinished anyway.",0,1,0,12,5,2021-09-29,2021-09-29,4025,403,1207,1207

Gameplay is table-top rpg flavored but way more like Fallout 1 and 2 than anything else with a one button switch from real-time to turn based.   Everything takes getting used to coming from other similar games, but once you get the hang of it, its really fun to work with.

"Completion Update:
It's still good,I had zero problems/crashes thanks to the patch I assume. It's a great setup.
In my 22 hours, I barely scratched the surface of content.After I completed the game, I went back to see some stuff so It won't be a spoiler for me. I missed tons of companions. I was only a bowman. No magic/no guns/no crafting. In one play through its nearly impossible to try everything properly. So you definitely need more than one. There is at least 40-50 hours worth of content. Worth the money.

Initial Note:

It's a great game but I am here to help you out with things you need to run this game on Windows 10. 
I am seeing tons of reviews how hard it is to get it running under W10. That is correct.
Somebody made a great patch that can make the game run under W10 in a neat package(It's not little it's 405 MB's) Don't bother with guides and multiple files or whatever.

"The game I have played thus far that feels closest to the freedom of a TTRPG experience. The amount of not just player choice, but harsh consequence for those choices, was something I did not think was possible for the video game medium. One moment you accept a small side-quest, next you might never be able to get back to a city easily anymore where you still have objectives, because every guard there wants you dead.. and it was all your choices, your doing.

The world actually reacts to you. If you kill (enough) people, it will not go forgotten. If your armor is broken and you are naked, it will be remarked on. If your character is ugly as sin, or one of the more monstrous races, people will treat you with the harshest bigotry. If you do something great, everyone in the city will gain some respect for you. If you are doing evil acts, good followers will not be happy for long. If you are a magic caster, don't expect to be allowed on trains when you get too strong, because your magic will mess with the steam engines. 

There are so many possible builds and individual experiences that the first 4 or so hours, I was just trying out different characters that I wanted to play. I was questioning my choice as half-orc, as everyone treated me badly. I was afraid my experience would be severely halted by this, but it ended up bringing so much flavor for me and influenced how I reacted to the world back, wanting to prove that my character was more than the world told her she was. It informed my every decision, kept me immersed. It influenced where I put my points, rather than what would be most meta or beneficial. If I would have gone with that charismatic elf instead, my choices would likely have been different... but you bet it makes me want to come back to it for that reason. I want to have that other experience. 

.. So the roleplay aspect is absolutely spot on.. however, what is outside of that somewhat suffers. Combat is a mess (especially real-time, which I started out with and therefore stuck with), navigation is a chore and most of the time you are questioning if something is intentional or just broken (I had Raven attack me continuously with stray arrows and I am still not sure if it is a bug or if she was just bad at hitting those arrows). If you don't save every few moments, you will regret it, because you can't walk far without assassins on your ass or the game risking a crash (even with unofficial patch). 

It is an amazing game, but it absolutely had me frustrated on the regular. It is the sort of game you think about so fondly whenever you are not playing it, but curse out as you are playing it (... sometimes). Overall, I love this game, but it is another broken Troika masterpiece. Flawed, but you can't help but like it.",1,1,0,8,0,2021-08-21,2021-08-21,160,7,2721,2717
"I owned the PC CD_ROM game Arcanum when it released just before 9/11 in 2001 (sorry for morbid reference, but that's why I remember when I got the game).  It is an open-world, point & click adventure game that was the first open-world game I played since the original Legend of Zelda.  It was released by the people who made the original Fallout game.  It was released with Sierra Online.  I did not like the open-world games in the early 2000's because they never held up to Arcanum to me.  It felt so ahead of its time when I played it back then, and it holds up today.  For example, I felt that the original Fallout was a good game, but the map was so small by comparison to Arcanum (which I played first even though Fallout came out in the late 1990s).  Arcanum feels more expansive than its contemporaries, and still feels huge even now.  I played thousands of hours of this game and I played as at least 10 different characters. good, bad and neutral, until my cat was caught munching on the disc after Troika went under.  I wanted to rebuy it, but couldn't find it for over a decade and a half.  When I saw Arcanum on Steam, my nostalgia bug made me buy it immediately, as I never forgot how much I loved this game. 

First of all, magic and steampunk technology...what?!  Hello?  Let's go!  I love a good fantasy game, esp. when there's magic and technology.  And just so you know how much I love the game's aesthetic, I redecorated my bedroom in steampunk not long before the pandemic.  

Weapons and armor can be light or heavy, tech or magic, given as a gift for completing quests, cheap or expensive, or you can make some of them yourself.  Learn from tech masters or the magic colleges. Worship the ancient god of each of the races.  Do it right and you'll be like a god yourself!  Not bad for someone who was getting his or her level one ass handed to them by basically ailing wolves and kites (look like little red cobolds).  

God-like powers aside, my favorite thing about this game is the freedom to do what you want.  You can play it a thousand times and never play the same character twice.  The followers are all so different, and I dig the way the good vs evil vs neutral runs of the game can give you such diverse experiences.  Even the followers are diverse.  There are 25 permanent followers (unless they leave or you kick them out), of all alignments and 5 or 6 temporary followers who will hang with you until you complete their side-quest.  Some followers who don't share your alignment may leave you or even attack you if you do too much they don't agree with.  

If it's your bag, there is a great strategy guide by Prima's Official on Amazon, with all maps, all items, main story, side quests, hidden quests, followers and who they will travel with, secret items, character creator options, where to find masters to train with for magic/technology/skills, and the full descriptions of even hidden things that are harder to find including where they are.  You can even find out which items are sold by which merchants with a description of what percent of the time they'll have them in stock.  It's super-comprehensive.  However, I would suggest at least trying on your own first, though.  If you explore the whole map, you'll find pretty much everything, including a lot of surprises.  Like stalk the whole map in every nook and cranny/  Just wandering around will also build up XP quickly by killing whoever/whatever you meet that attacks you, and it won't put off your good or bad followers if the people you kill attacked first.  I played on my own first then went back with a relatively neutral half-elf and played with the strategy guide so I'd see what I missed.  There's so much to find, with or without the guide.  Now, I just use the guide mostly for the maps (I'm lazy about remembering locations).  Finally, a quick review of the game mechanics is on Wikipedia, along with a synopsis that I recommend you don't read unless you've played before.  The surprises are half the fun of the story.  

In summary, this game remains one of my favorites, and I am not alone.  It sold well, was well-received by critics, and won some awards.  I highly recommend it even now, despite all the open world games that are newer.  The few things people complained about never affected my gameplay, and it plays just as well on Steam as it did on CD_ROM.  It's a download requiring about 1 GB of space, so it's a large game for when it came out.  Make sure you have room.  If your friends also have it, it has a multiplayer mode.  Play turn-based, fast turn-based, or real-time.  So many options and replay potential...I missed this game and I appreciate so much that Steam brought it back.

Good luck if you decide to try it!  This rabbit hole runs deep, but what a great ride!",1,1,0,6,1,2021-08-21,2021-08-21,0,7,26412,9410
"Listen here Lads and Lasses, I have FAR more time in this game than what is shown. Once I got the Widescreen Mod, (Which I HIGHLY recommend), it stopped logging My time. This is one of the GREATEST RPG's ever! It is absolutely fantastic! Whether you go Sword n"" Board, Wizard, or Tech Guru, it is engaging, interesting, grim, and just amazing. I rank it up there with the original Baldur's Gate, it IS that good. I have 5 Characters currently, all doing completely different things, and I'm loving exploring the world of Arcanum.",1,1,0,3,0,2021-08-13,2021-08-13,0,17,76,76
"Ok so I saw someone complaining that they had to restart the game when they get stuck in turn based mode. All you have to do, is double tap spacebar to go out of and back into turn based mode. This will fix the problem. Sincerely, an Arcanum veteran.

This is one of those highly underrated hidden gems from back in the day. Before Steam was even a thing, I put hundreds and hundreds of hours into it. I highly recommend this game if you like old isometric RPGs. The game incorporates guns, swordplay, magic, and invention into the combat system. If you use guns, magic becomes increasingly ineffective on you as you progress in the tech tree. And vice versa for magic. Say you are a powerful magic user. Try to use a gun and it will backfire on you. The characters and story are so engaging too. No character is essential, so you can really screw up the story if you kill the wrong person. Everything you do effects the characters' disposition towards you in a small way, even scars on your face from combat effect your beauty rating, making people like you less. You can receive blessings and curses that effect all kinds of aspects of gameplay. What's also really cool is that creating a custom starting bonus and background for your character is super easy. Just edit a couple of text files, and you pretty much created your own mod! I like making backgrounds like ""Attacked by Bees"", which gives you a penalty to your beauty stat but a high constitution, giving you resistance to poison, and giving my character better starting equipment. Any custom background you can imagine is super easy to create. Thought I owned it on GOG, bought it on Steam to use the overlay. Found out you can't use the overlay. Went over to GOG, I apparently don't have an account. So I'm buying it again :)",1,0,0,1,0,2021-08-13,2022-12-24,132,61,487,6

"Gierka prosta. 
Kilka porad dla początkujących:
Proponowane buildy:

1. Mag: harm(black necromancy), agilidy fire, disarm+ unlocking cantrip (pakujemy w te spelle na początku)
 -> na 5 poziomie fireflash. Opcjonalnie dalej Z magii Mental -> Stun. 
Taktyka: 
- z daleka w urkyciu używamy Unlocking cantrip na zamkniete skrzynie, drzwi, beczki (zostają one permanentnie otwarte, nie to co w przypadku używaniu lockpick)
- otwieranie skrzynek, drzwi, beczek spellem jak mamy skuteczność magią po wyżej 90%
- na mniejsze grupki przeciwników używamy Harm, później po odblokowaniu Fireflash - używamy na wieksze grupki (trzeba się zaopatrzyć w duże ilości potek z maną i dodatkowo potki Haste)
- w walce używamy agilidy fire x2 na siebie - zwiększa nam dexteryty - czyli szybkość - wiecej razy atakujemy

2. Mag melle+backstab: agilidy fire, disarm+ unlocking cantrip (pakujemy w te spelle na początku) + 1 w melle i 1 w backstab. Na początku ze sklepu wybieramy Dagger
Pakujemy przy nowych poziomach w melle i backstab aż do maxa (najpierw używamy na sobie agilidy fire 2x - co nam zwiększy dexterity).  Dalej Z magii Mental -> Stun. - stun powoduje że obrażenia będą kilkukrotne
Taktyka:
- w walce używamy agilidy fire x2 na siebie - zwiększa nam dexteryty - czyli szybkość - wiecej razy atakujemy i zachodzimy ZAWSZE przeciwnikowi za plecy i wtedy atakujemy
- z daleka w urkyciu używamy Unlocking cantrip na zamkniete skrzynie, drzwi, beczki (zostają one permanentnie otwarte, nie to co w przypadku używaniu lockpick)
- do póki nie odblokujemy expert backstab - naszą bronią bedzie tylko dagger
- przedmioty wybieramy tylko z magicznymi bonusami
- otwieranie skrzynek, drzwi, beczek spellem jak mamy skuteczność magią po wyżej 90%
- po odblokowaniu backstab expert możemy używać dowolnej broni: proponuje DAgger of speed albo jakąś broń z dodatkowymi obrażeniami
- niektóre bronie mogą wymagać określonej punkty siły żeby dobrze działać 

3. Postać nie magiczna - Technolog: Melle + Backstab: na początku bierzemy agilidy fire i 2 melle 2 backstab oraz ze sklepu wybieramy sztylet oraz wytrychy. W kolejnych lvlach pakujemy do maxa melle i backstab. Dalej 4 punkty rozdajemy w: Explodives - Molotov coctail, Smithy - Pure ore, Balanced Sword, Feather - weight axe. Musimy odblokować backstab expert i zdobyć krasnoludzkie ore oraz recepte na Pirotechnic axe (będzie trzeba użyć potki na Inteligencje przy tworzeniu). 
Tu poradnik jak zdobyć najlepszą broń melle: pirotechnic axe (dla technologa) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNjOcBLE3p8
W przypadku technologa:
- Używamy przedmiotów bez magicznych bonusów (mogą wystąpić krytyczne niepowodzenia)
- Przy wyższych lvlach technologii przestaną na nas działać czary leczące towarzyszy i potki więc musimy używać: Healing slave, Fatigue restorer, można postawić 2 punkty w tym drzewku żeby samodzielnie to robić, lub kupować/okradać sprzedawców
- Musimy zainwestować w Lockpicking (wymaxować plus minimum experta odblokować) - zapisywać przed lockpikingiem - bo zamek przy niepowodzeniach może sie zaciąć
- opcjonalnie można iść w gun/bow/trow (jak kto woli, ja polecam gun - tu poradnik jak zrobic najlepsza bron gun https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39hHIzOfN1M)
- opcjonalnie można odblokować granaty stunujące - tak samo jak u maga - stun powoduje zwiększenie obrażeń 

Taktyka:
- póki nie wymaksujemy dexterity używamy 2x agilidy fire na siebie i ZAWSZE zachodzimy przeciwnika za plecy i wtedy atakujemy
- nie używamy ekwipunku magicznego - można samodzielnie stworzyć ekwipunek dla technologa

Kilka końcowych porad:
1. jeżeli chcemy okraść sprzedawców z niektórych itemów (np kluczy) W opcjach wybierzmy opcję: Czekaj do wieczora + czekaj 2H, następnie idziemy za sprzedawcą lub innym NPC z kluczem i innym itemem, używamy agilidy fire i okradamy go
2. jeżeli chcemy użyć lockpick na drzwiach, skrzynce lub beczce muśimy być w trybie skradania i NIE MOŻEMY być zauważeni przez sprzedawce lub innego NPC (najlepiej kucnąc przy drzwiach lub skrzynce i zobaczyć czy NPC sie nie obruci w naszą stronę
3. przedmioty u stprzedawców się zmieniają/odnawiają co 24h - odchodzimy od nich żeby nie byli oni widoczni - wychodzimy do innego budynku i wybieramy opcję : czekaj 1 dzień i wracamy do sprzedawcy, można u niego kupic nowe itemy lub go okraść (skrzynkę, beczkę)
4. jeżeli chcemy szybko odblokować expert backstab, to w pierwszym mieście nie akceptujemy questa na pozbycie się bandytó przy północnym moście, tylko idziemy do nich i wykonujemy questa, żeby odblokować gildie złodzieji w Tarant i po wykonaniu jednogo questa uczymy się tam expert backstab. Poradnik -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNjOcBLE3p8
5. w przypadku walki z robotami:
- czary nie działają lub są mniej skuteczne (najlepiej chyba używać Harm - black necromancy)
- broń melle się psuje (trzeba zamienic swoją główną broń na jakąś zwykłą którą można poświęcić i wyrzucić)
- opcjonalnie gun/bow/throw (broń się nie niszczy)",1,1,0,0,0,2021-08-03,2021-08-03,0,10,273,264
"Идеальная олдовая RPG со всеми сопутствующими механиками.

"Начну обзор с того, что первое время мне было очень сложно играть, Арканум меня не затянул и показался непонятным, скучным и муторным. Графика после нынешних игр показалась просто вырвиглазной, интерфейс неудобный, сложная система развития героя, никакого обучения и подсказок. 
Но потом, потратив время и разобравшись, я была поражена, насколько игра оказалась интересной. 
Мир Арканума - просто потрясающий, отличный сюжет, проработанные диалоги и квесты. Даже побочные задания очень интересные, не как обычно «пойди убей/принеси дцать чего-то, раскиданного по всей карте», а действительно маленькие истории, иногда жуткие, иногда забавные, но не похожие друг на друга и с разными вариантами их прохождения.
Как уже писала, в игре сложная, но интересная система развития героя, помимо характеристик и умений, можно прокачивать знания в разных областях, получая при этом схемы крафта, если играешь за технолога, или заклинания, если магом. 
И вообще в игре много стоящих механик, которые так или иначе влияют на персонажа и прохождение игры. Например, несовместимость магии и технологии: моя гг при высоком уровне технологии не могла использовать магические вещи, и маги-торговцы отказывались не то, что торговать, даже разговаривать, а в поездах не провозили некоторых моих спутников.
И так, обобщу все свои за и против.
Плюсы:
- Шикарный лор игры. Сюжет, квесты, диалоги – просто отличные. Разработчики весьма потрудились над этим.
- Прокачка персонажа. Любителям билдостроения  понравится широкий выбор возможностей.
- Крафт. Можно создавать много вкусного и полезного даже из мусора.
- Возможность выбора пошаговой боевки в настройках.
Минусы:
- Высокий порог вхождения в игру. Это олдскульная игра. Без стартового обучения, без интуитивно понятного и привычного интерфейса, без разжеванных объяснений. Арканум не водит тебя за ручку, во всем надо разбираться самостоятельно.
- Старая графика. Глаза реально уставали от картинки.
- Ну и баги, куда без них.
Подытоживая написанное, стоит ли играть в Арканум? Если вас не пугают сложности и устаревшая графика, однозначно стоит. Не смотря на минусы, это потрясающая игра, оригинальная, не похожая на другие, интересная и затягивающая.",1,0,0,11,0,2021-07-22,2021-07-22,0,8,5804,5804

"Игра одна из лучших представителей РПГ. Игровой мир редкий - классическое Фентези дожившее до эпохи паровоза и телеграфа. Делалась при участии людей из Black Isle. Добрые традиции Фоллаутов присутствуют. Реиграбельность высока.
Игра старая - вести за руку по указателям там не будут. Диалоги надо читать, думать над ответами. (По сему без знания английского для 1-ого прохождения русификатор обязателен). Побочные квесты надо искать. Изучение внутригровой информации персонажем ведет к игровым возможностям. Большинство прочитанных текстов вознаграждается от квеста до пари на эрудицию.
Боевая система - пошаговый или реальное время в изометрии. Баланс в нем никто не делал. Что-то сверх сила в пошаговом (удар в спину), что-то сверх сила в реальном времени. В конце концов игра сингл-плейер с возможностью окончить местным богом. Какой такой баланс?
Для игравших давно. Присутствует ряд мелких, но ощутимых изменений в версии на Steam. Монстры чаше и разнообразней колдуют. Самое пакостное (на мой взгляд) - шанс попадания зависит от соотношения маго-техно склонностей цели, атакующего и принадлежности оружия. Чего не было. Так поразить на 100 волшебного противника (синего зомбака например) из техно пушки при собственной не большой техно склонности почти не реально (штраф около 100%), а обычным дрыном или волшебным нормально. Это полная попа-боль для огнестрельного - половина мобов волшебные - или вкачивай 100 техно сходу, или они для пуль останутся неуязвимы, и с компаньонами напрягает.",1,1,0,0,0,2021-07-18,2021-07-18,0,4,47990,9861

"Arcanum to jeden z tytułów, który zapisał się w anałach gier RPG złotymi zgłoskami. Gra tworzona częściowo przez osoby odpowiedzialne za sławnego Fallouta, na przestrzeni lat stała się kultowa i posiada swoje grono fanów, którzy naprawiają i rozwijają ją do naszych czasów. W zeszłym roku wyszedł Unofficial Arcanum Patch 2.0.2, poprawiający działanie gry na nowszych systemach, z tej okazji postanowiłem odświeżyć sobie tego klasyka. Warto nadmienić, że w moim prywatnym rankingu, gra była w pierwszej 20 najlepszych RPG w tamtym okresie. Niestety słowo była to dobre określenie, bo po odświeżeniu sobie rozgrywki spadła poza pierwszą 50, o ile nie dalej...

Zanim z moich ust posypie się fala krytyki, (Albo raczej z klawiatury:)) pozwólcie, że dodam coś na swoją obronę. Ostatnio odświeżam sobie sporo klasyków, od Baldursów, po Fallouty, Wizardy itp. Trochę tego w ostatnich 5-ciu latach ograłem i nic, ale to zupełnie nic, nie przygotowało mnie na tak słabo wykonaną walkę oraz poszlakową, rozlazłą kampanię główną. W porównaniu do wcześniej wymienionych gier przypowieść o maszynach i magii mnie zawiodła i niestety w przeciwieństwie do w/w nie obroniła się w moich oczach. Jeśli kiedyś nie wyjdzie jakiś remake tej gry lub remaster poprawiający balans i walkę, to jest to prawdopodobnie moje ostatnie spotkanie z tym tytułem i nie zamierzam do niego nigdy wracać. Trochę szkoda, bo są aspekty, które zatrzymały mnie przy tym tytule na kilkadziesiąt godzin (Poza sentymentem oraz próbą przełamania się do grania dalej), a są nimi klimat steampunkowego świata, świetna muzyka oraz broniąca się w moich oczach do dzisiaj grafika. Niestety monotonia i głupota walk, jakże istotnego elementu każdego RPG, wyklucza tę produkcję z listy moich ulubionych.

[h1]Co z tą walką jest nie tak?[/h1]

Mam wrażenie, jakby twórcy nie mogli się zdecydować, czy chcą zrobić grę turową, czy może H&S. Postanowili więc zmiksować oba te gatunki, co dało niestety mizerny efekt, bo gra nie jest dobra ani jako turówka, ani jako H&S. Jeśli do tego dodamy taką sobie SI towarzyszy, nad którymi nie mamy żadnej kontroli, to zrozumiemy, czemu ten system się nie sprawdza. Gra sprowadza się to do tego, że na niższych poziomach ""podprowadzamy"" po jednym potworku, a na wyższych zazwyczaj mamy sporą przewagę, więc zwyczajnie wyżynamy wszystko jak leci. Jeśli na domiar złego wybrałeś ścieżkę maga, to cała walka sprowadza się do naciskania jednego, czasami dwóch czarów, w tym leczeniu głupiutkich członków drużyny pchających się pod topór niezależnie od sytuacji oraz przyzwania jakiegoś potworka. Ot cała taktyka maga. Odrobinę ciekawiej jest technologiem, ale też na cuda nie liczcie. W tym systemie brakuje taktyki, ale brakuje też akcji.

[h1]Rozwój bohatera.[/h1]

Kolejnym czynnikiem, na którym zawiodłem się połowicznie, jest rozwój bohatera. Na początek mała porada: Nie grajcie magiem, bo czar gry pryska w połowie. Czemu tak się dzieje, zapytacie? W grze nie poznacie żadnych nowych czarów. Wszystkie dostępne czary są wyszczególnione w drzewku rozwoju postaci i na nic innego nie liczcie. Do końca gry rozwiniecie kilka szkół magii na maksa, a każda szkoła to pięć czarów, więc do 50 poziomu poznacie jakieś 20 - 30 czarów, z czego i tak będziecie używać 3 może 4 zaklęcia z całej palety. Znacznie ciekawsza jest ścieżka technologa, ponieważ poza schematami odblokowywanymi w drzewku rozwoju, możemy znaleźć sporo receptur w świecie gry, a oprócz tego zyskujemy szybki dostęp do naprawy przedmiotów, majstrowania przy maszynach, ulepszania ekwipunku itp. Niestety granie magiem w tej grze daje sporo mniej frajdy niż technologiem i stąd mój częściowy zawód tą grą po latach.(Tak, tym razem grałem nudnym magiem)

[h1]Fabuła główna oraz zadania poboczne.[/h1]

Tutaj ponownie przeżyłem częściowy zawód. Pomijam już f.akt, że znalazłem kilka niespójności w świecie gry, ale bardziej niż te niespójności, uderzyła mnie poszlakowa kampania główna. Grając, miałem wrażenie, jakby mój arcywróg nie istniał, albo nie angażował się w ten świat wystarczająco. Nie miałem poczucia, że ratuję świat przed złem, a raczej, że gonię za poszlakami od miasta do miasta, walcząc z przypadkowymi potworami po drodze. Uczucie, że główne zadanie szyte jest grubymi nićmi, w Arcanum jest wyjątkowo silne. Odrobinę ratują sytuację ciekawe lokacje oraz zadania poboczne, które wyszły autorom całkiem nieźle, a spora ich część to fajne mini kampanie. Aby nie spolerować wspomnę tylko o zadaniu z ołtarzami oraz labiryncie. A takich smaczków jest dużo, dużo więcej i myślę, że to właśnie one utrzymały mnie przy grze tyle godzin. Eksploracja oraz poszukiwanie sekretów w tej grze daje sporo frajdy.

[h1]Grafika oraz muzyka.[/h1]

Nareszcie jakiś aspekt Arcanum, który w moich wspomnieniach oraz w rzeczywistości obronił się całkowicie. Muzyka w tej grze to prawdziwe arcydzieło, które uwielbiam słuchać nawet poza grą. Natomiast graficznie gra prezentuje podobny poziom co starszy brat Fallout. Mapy, książki, przedmioty w ekwipunku oraz uzbrojenie, wszystko ma klimacik steampunkowy. Podobnie jest z lokacjami. Zapyziałe wioski górnicze, miasta upadłych królestw, ruiny, czy też szaro-bure industrialne miasta z wczesnej ery przemysłowej, wpisują się w klimat steampunkowy idealnie. Można by długo wymieniać, bo jest tego tutaj naprawdę sporo i każdy lubiący takie klimaty znajdzie coś dla siebie. Zarówno muzyka, jak i grafika mocno podsycają klimat, który panuje w tej grze i prawdopodobnie za to kiedyś tę grę ceniłem tak wysoko.

[h1]PODSUMOWANIE:[/h1]
W moich wspomnieniach o Arcanum nigdy nie było walki, teraz po odświeżeniu sobie gry, rozumiem dlaczego. Nie polecam tego tytułu graczom nastawionym na walkę. Natomiast jeśli jesteś w stanie przełknąć ten aspekt rozgrywki oraz średniawą, żeby nie powiedzieć słabą fabułę główną, to czeka cię ciekawa przypowieść o maszynach i magii(Jeśli zagrasz technologiem). Gra ocieka wręcz klimatem steampunkowym podsycanym przez wspaniałą muzykę i między innymi dlatego dostaje ocenę pozytywną.

[h1]OCENA:
6,5/10 od biedy naciągane sentymentem 7/10[/h1]

Ta ocena nie do końca oddaje moje odczucia względem rozgrywki, więc na koniec pozwolę sobie jeszcze ocenić kilka elementów z osobna, aby bardziej obrazowo wyrazić co myslę o tym klasyku:
[b]Muzyka: 9/10
Grafika: 7,5/10
Walka: 4/10
Fabuła główna: 5/10
Zadania poboczne: 8/10

Everything about this game is great!  The atmosphere, the story, the setting, the dialog, the RPG elements, the choices you make, the characters, the multiple ways to solve problems.  This is even better than Fallout 2 was back in the day!!!

Except the combat sucks sooooooooooooo  F'ing bad.  It's AWFUL.  It's a bunch of sprites bonking heads on screen.  It feels like I'm playing an NES game from 1992.  

What good is a game if you despise the combat?  Sorry but that makes all the great things about the game not worth it.  As much as it pains me to, I have to say pass on this.  Play Fallout 2 instead.",0,1,0,7,3,2021-06-19,2021-06-19,0,53,134,134
"Stumbled upon this old relic from eons past. I remember playing it as a teenager back before Dwarves invented steam power. Countless hours playing this from a disk. When I found it on steam, I put it on the wish list as I was balls deep in another game at the time and it went on sale a week later so I bought it.

It is an old school RPG where you click on the ground to move and click on an enemy to auto attack. There are two paths you can choose. Magic or Technology. Progressing in one diminishes the effectiveness of the other. Being a tech guy you can make and use all manner of marvelous machines but the better you get, you might wanna find a tech replacement for your magical healer in your party as you impede each other's effectiveness. His spells won't work as well on you and I believe (although I've not noticed) your tech fails in the presence of magic.

Gameplay is a bit slow and the background music is dreary and depressing but that's the scene of the narrative.

"Минутка адекватности. 
Хочу набросить на ореол почитания который сложился вокруг этой игры. Обычно все претензии сводятся к убогому интерфейсу, багам, качеству перевода и т.д. Часть проблем решается фанатскими сборками, но увы недостатки этой игры гораздо глубже и их принято замалчивать. 
Думаю я не открою Америку если скажу, что игра недоделана процентов на 30%. Всю игру вы будете встречать огрызки вырезанных или урезанных механик, недоделки встречают вас уже в меню создания персонажа, ведь в игре 8 играбельных рас и только для 4х из них сделан женский вариант. Можно сколько угодно доказывать, что это сюжетно обосновано, только вот мужчине полуорку все хамят, а женщине полуорку нет, потому что на всех женщин игра реагирует одинаково. Ну и плюс хамство это весьма условное, ""простите, извините"" и с вами уже запускается стандартный диалог. Это же относится и к тупым(пьяным) персонажам. 
И так во всём. У игры сумасшедшие амбиции, а на таком фоне срезание углов видно невооружённым взглядом. У части спутников есть озвучка, у части нет. В самом проработанном городе Тарант 2/3 квестов это убогое убей/принеси, а треть - интереснейшие квесты которые можно решить тремя путями. Чем дальше от Таранта тем всё становится хуже. Шаблон типичного ""регионального"" квеста: иди в данжен и всех убей. Высокое убеждение? Можешь не идти. Ты злой? Тогда воруй@убивай ключевой квестовый итем . И тут же появляется квест нетипичный, от которого дух захватывает. Однако обычно когда в целом городе всего пару квестов и несколько ключевых НПС это норма.
Ролевая система тоже вызывает вопросы. Поиск ловушек и их обезвреживание это разные навыки. Азартные игры привычно бесполезны во всех РПГ. Ремонт не нужен (починят в ближайшем городе). Помимо силы, ловкости и инты, есть аж целая характеристика ""красота"", которая влияет на отношение к вам НПС, которое ни на что по факту не влияет. Особенно при наличии заклинания первого уровня которое очаруют любого НПС. Нормально, да?
Система магия/технология задумывалась как инструмент реиграбельности. И отчасти это правда, это самая обширная система крафта и магических заклинаний что я видел, но часто это выглядит настолько смехотворно и неадекватно что портит всё погружение начисто. Это всё понимаешь, когда проходишь игру второй раз. Ощущения одинаковые. Что ты из пистолета расстреливаешь врагов, что из магического лука. Специализированный торгаш с вами отказывается говорить, потому что вы технолог/маг а послать того же Вирджила за покупками нельзя (условности-с). Вас откажутся сажать на паровоз, но через дорогу стоит универсальный корабль. У всего магического есть технологический аналог. Доходит до того, что прямо в квесте тебе дают решения для обоих вариантов. Например надо закрыть демонический портал и в тумбочке неподалёку лежит соответсвующий свиток И механический закрыватель.
Про недоделки можно писать часами. Но есть и другой ключевой недостаток. Скука. Люди которые прошли её в далёком 2001 скорее любят вспоминать эту игру чем играть в неё именно по этой самой причине. Квесты это как правило бесконечная унылая беготня по огромной но пустой карте. Последний сложный бой это бой за выход со стартовой локации. Деньги перестанут быть проблемой после Таранта. Веселья от прожимания скиллов в пошаговых боях пропадёт через 10 часов. Знаете как вы скорее всего будете играть? Включите реалтайм и натравите своё ""стадо"", враги ничего кроме промахов вам противопоставить не смогут. От глобальной карты вы так устанете что станете задумываться не прокачать ли технологу телепортацию (да она работает даже при технологиях 100 левела). Тысячи пустых диалогов с этим фейковым викторианским джентльменством, где даже последнее быдло знает слово сэр, вы будете просто прокликивать. В какой-то момент вы поймаете себя на мысли что играете в игру от юбисофт. И держать вас будет именно ожидание что игра подкинет что-нибудь прикольное. И она подкидывает, этим она сильнее всего и раздражает. Ощущением что всё могло закончиться не так.
Я к чему всё это веду. Эта игра хорошая, но задохнувшаяся в своих же собственных амбициях. Комментарии не отключаю, если возмущён и хочешь что-то сказать, не сдерживай себя и пиши смело.",0,1,0,67,7,2021-05-20,2021-05-21,0,32,10,10

"Arcanum. The game that was released nearly 20 years ago, and still considered one of the ten, maybe one of the hot five best games in the steampunk setting. And one of the deepest RPG universes, with all those magic vs. technology Yin/Yang collisions, with so much diversity in the possible playstyles, characters, situations, and all that jazz. And It Is actually one of the greatest videogames I ever played, all hands down. It still has its 'one more quest, one more turn' needle of the strong addiction. I've played it on the release, and I still enjoy playing it now.

But.

With all that deep immersion, all those tons of quests, stories, and other nice and cozy stuff, Arcanum always had that ugly taint of the bad coding. Only the list of its technical problems can be longer than the compilation of all dialogs in many modern RPGs.

It all starts with the resolution. '800х600х65536' was already dated when the game hit the shelves. I remember some tweaking we did about it with other boys from the neighborhood, and it was before we get access to the Internet, because it was much more expensive and overall complicated than now. And you know what? Every time when I was reinstalling Arcanum after that, there were some new issues to fight with. But every time, it was something about weird resolution and screen behavior, for starters.

And what about now? Is it working? Is it dead, or still alive?
Well, you can play it out of the box, just by installing the game (thanks to the GOG release with resolution fix, I presume). Like I said from the start, it is still one of the greatest isometric RPGs. It is still providing just as much delight for any genre connoisseur, as it did in 2001. But, there are 95% chances that you'll need to download some unofficial, fan-made patch, to fix something. So tread consciously.

Speaking of the overall rating for Arcanum, it's a really complicated issue for me. For the provided content, it's kinda 9.5/10. For the technical realization, I dunno... 5/10? It's bugged as hell, and it still bothers me even with the latest patch installed. I love Arcanum, and it haunts and hurts me. A great game. Burns like the summer sun.",1,1,0,86,3,2021-05-16,2021-05-17,2880,599,8213,8213
"A decent CRPG but lacks polish.  Most of the dialogue and quests in the game are extremely dry and uninspired.  Most of characters you talk to feel like they're just interactive sign posts to point you in the direction you need to go, with no defining characteristics.  

The game play is also very unbalanced, with magic being much better than any other build.   The combat is also fairly janky, ranging from massive RNGfests to effortless steamroll depending on your build. 

You NEED to install the unoffical patch unless you want to play at extreme low resolutions without widescreen.   

Give it a go if you want to try a CRPG in a unique setting, but don't expect a game with the same quality of Fallout 1/2.",1,1,0,13,0,2021-05-11,2021-05-11,0,18,2578,807
"A jankier Fallout set in a fantasy land undergoing an industrial revolution. I love the amount of work that has gone into worldbuilding. It's not just an aesthetic choice or a flimsy context to have guns, steam engines and tophats. The subject of industrialization and its consequences is treated with a thoughtfulness that I haven't even seen in some ""historical"" games.

Character creation and progression are some of the very best around; there's a lot of room for experimentation, and the game makes an effort to accommodate different playstyles in its quest design.

It's a shame, then, that the biggest flaw this game has is the combat. You can switch between turn-based and real-time on the fly; both feel half-baked, and the encounter design is hot garbage: endless waves of enemies with nary a need for strategizing on your part.

"Hermoso.

50 a 70 horas de haber escrito esto (Aprox, lo jugué con patches que usan un exe aparte, por lo que no me contó el tiempo), finalmente me lo pasé y no solo no me esperaba que un rpg tan viejo me mantuviera inmerso, si no que tampoco esperaba que me enganchase mas de lo que algunos juegos lo hacen hoy en día.

No voy a meterme tan a fondo pero si quiero hacer un comentario respecto a la premisa. Si bien trata de un mundo de fantasía en el que se llega a una pseudo revolución industrial y tecnológica, está muy bueno porque lo toma desde los ojos de una persona real. Toca la fantasía pero siempre con ese tacto propio de un equipo que tiene los pies en la tierra y del lado de la lógica, evitando el error que cometen muchos de simplemente meter cosas que parezcan ""Cool"" en un mundo de fantasía industrial. Esto puede parecer una nimiedad, pero comparado con los juegos de hoy en día que llevan la fantasía a un extremo de incredibilidad exagerada, es refrescante jugar algo que uno puede creer sin tener que cuestionar absolutamente todo y solucionar cuarenta mil plotholes con cuarenta mil headcannons distintos.

Si bien me pareció precioso, sería un juego que se beneficiaría mucho de un soft remake ya que algunos conceptos, diálogos y acontecimientos por momento llegan a dar cringe, especialmente los diálogos.

Si lo llegás a jugar te recomiendo buscar en yt o reddit una guía que te habla de los mods que hacen el juego cómodo de jugar con los estándares de hoy en día (Alta resolución, UI scaling, fixes, etc).

The actual gameplay is a bit of a slog. I didn't play old-school Western RPGs back in the day. Took me a minute to figure out fast travel, and frankly combat is boring and the palette is dark and makes it hard to distinguish buildings and NPCs at first glance. Also they missed a golden oppurtunity not making Virgil a love interest and I'm still salty about it.

Recommend: 
Turn Based Combat
Use of a Walkthrough as strategy guide to cut down on confusing levels, maps, and hidden npcs in large sprawling maps. Arcanum Fandom Wiki is a great place to start.
Use of Unofficial Patch UAP 2.0.2 which reintroduces exotic races for player characters, allow XP sharing without the educator perk and disabling XP gained on hit and instead giving party XP on kills. enables widescreen resolution and fixes bugs and increases level cap for more variety in builds. You can right click on teammates portraits for a dropdown menu including combat orders.
If you decide ton install UAP remember to install it in the SECOND arcanum folder(inside the first arcanum folder). Feel free to enable most if not all of the optional options as they were curated by the modmaker.

Tips: You can end combat with the red shield button on the left side of the hud. You can use spacebar to quickly togger into Turn Based Combat or Back into Real time Combat. You can enable auto run to make travelling smoother. You can manually start combat by pressing the red shield, pressing R. You can Right click outta combat icon back to talking iconl. You can hold ALT while clicking in combat mode to destroy objects such as jammed doors. You can read the manual by pressing the button in the launcher. You can populate the toolbar from the open inventory by drag&drop of potions, grenades, lockpicks and other items. It is possible to scrounge large amounts of small sellable items such as shoes and iron daggers that you can sell to merchants as well as crafting materials from rubbish bins that respawn somewhat daily. Enemy corpses will still have their weapons and armors equipped in a separate window and not in the main loot window. So use the left red arrow LOOT ALL to get those, or manually open their paperdoll inventory by clicking the appropriate small button. if you dont want to blow up the generator in shrouded hills you can get the dernholm location from a human villager by a cow south east of percivals house after you heard of Dernholm from Percival. In arcanum mages can cast while wearing armor and can even benefit from special arcane armors. Sometimes the examine function at shops or to shop enemy health will no longer work. Exiting the game and returning seems to remove the default name-only descriptions and restore the proper examine information from hovering the mouse. You can right click to directly transfer items over to shopkeepers or across companion inventory. The numbers next to crafting components indicate the required skill level and the icon the skill type, it does NOT meant the number of components required to craft one. 1 point in a disciple ~= 10 points. Rubbish bins can be use to discard unwanted items since they respawn while chests in inns and the warehouse in tarant can be used as storage. You can mouse over the Sword and Shield icons in the character sheet to see a detailed breakdown of attack and defense stats to compare results of different gear. Drag and drop large items like armors to toolbar to make space. Right click drag and drop to return them to inventory. You can advance time one hour (small icon at top right of screen) to refill magicka. Use the KEY, BLUEWORLD and GEAR to access SKILLS MAGIC AND TECH. Click on map to add waypoints, big round button to GO. Buy multiple manuals of same type to stack additional free tech skill points based on INT. If you get 5 spells in a college and do the mastery dungeon you dont need to wear amulet to get the 50% mana discount on sustained and direct spells.

Liam Cameron Portal Method
A much faster & efficient way to level up is by killing monsters that come through the portal in Find Liam Cameron quest. The monsters spawning through the portal will let you level up extremely fast. However, the monsters are very strong so make sure you can kill them fast.
-- Personal Note: Monsters stopped spawning randomly after a short while --

Overworld Exploring Method !! This Method also gives gold if you kill Molochian Agents!!
If you travel from location to location in the overworld, more often than not you will encounter random enemies which will attack you on sight. You can simply keep travelling around in the overworld endlessly and kill the monsters you encounter. Some areas of the world map have higher encounter frequencies than others; check WMap_Rnd.mes for more information.",1,0,0,1,0,2021-03-30,2021-06-23,1865,4460,3396,827
"This is one of the greatest, fundamentally flawed games you will ever play.
It's was a huge creative achievement, everything from the music (it has one of best soundtracks in video game history) to voice acting, to story itself is amazing and just as enjoyable today as it was back in the day.

I don't think there ever was a CRPG title where you could roleplay charismatic leader leading a group of competent and deadly individuals. Point is, you can play Arcanum in million and one way, and although there are superior character builds (magic in particular is overpowered) each is viable in it's own way.

Now for the bad. Even for the time Arcanum was rough around the edges. It's not ugly but it lacks polish other CRPG titles had (Baldur's or Planescape or even Fallout). 
AI is atrocious, there's simply no way around it. You cannot modify the behavior of your followers which makes certain party members almost useless. For example, embracing technology makes it so your character resists any magic influence (healing spells included). If you get hurt while having a Virgil (magic healer) in a group, he will proceed to spell himself into a coma trying to heal you. Balance is all over the place and it can be difficult to get of the ground if you're low charisma technologist for example while mage will stomp everything into a pulp. 

But even with everything said there's just something about arcanum that makes me want to play it over and over again. Not sure if it's nostalgia inducing melancholy soundtrack or the fact that crafting in this game is actually purposeful and can support variety of playstyles. 
It's a game well worth your time.",1,0,0,13,0,2021-03-29,2021-03-29,1238,48,2644,2613

"""Из великой книги похождений полу-огра ""Возрожденного"". И прочих бредней барда Бидля"".

Твоя заткнись! Моя умный, моя история рассказывай:

Случилося это как-то зимой. Моя летееееть на небесный шарик. В город. Большой город, где грят много всяких дел для огрив давают. И денежка платют! Но тут бах! Бах! Налетай небесные кастрюли с оркой! Да как бах нас всех. Ужас, моя страшна.! Но потом очнулся.. все мертвыя вокругь. Я живой. Я крут, я молодеца! Рядом парнишка появляйся. Крепко у него пукан гори от того, что его реин.. ренкарна..рекур.. рекламация, корочи, бога-острухого колдунишки стань полу-огр. Ну я ему скажи: ""Или я, или по шапке получай за наезды такие!"". Он сразу присмирель. И вот тута началася игра.

И, как вродя говорил мой игрок-с: ""В рот я **** стима с его хeровыми, как моя рассказ, интиграциянами! Ни огра ни орка не работать как нада! Все подвисаетъ! Одна и та же карта грузиться как будто сейчас не 2021, а время-время, когда у Пеньков..Пенитиумовъ после названия стояли три цифры!"". Потому ему, грит, сначала надай идти на ZOG искай фикс 1.3. Но зог давно червивый как гнилой зуб мояей прабабки огрихи! Хуже портовой девки - ни толку-ма, ни удовольствий! Потому шел он далеко на arcanumclub . ru и качай там. Тама хороший был файл.
 Но вот беда - все тормозит, тормозит как после 10й кружка пива. Даже волка бегай, как игрок-с сказал... А! ""Бегают 1-4 fps в секунду, твою мaть!"". И надо бы это править-латать. Хотело была он снова на ZOG, но думай что от венеры сейчас дорого лечиться. Потому пошел в руководства стима. На англиканский раздел. И там нашел хороший мануаль, где (в отличии от ZOGа триклятого) было пополкам раскладано, как сделай и как запускай! Так он называйся: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755396888] Fix for slowdown [/url] . И бальшая авторяму спасиба!

Вышли мы значится в город. Мне там торгаш давай предлагать пушки, да колотушки. Но моя умная! Моя бери меч большой, да началося тута! Сразу анимации смертей как в фоллычах покатили. Волки шинкуются, людишки на две половины падай! Пока моя мечом крути, да лохов побеждай не глядь, не глядь как очутился в Таранте. Где мой игрок-с хотя сказать: ""Большое спасибо канализациям Таранта за то, что почти любое название тамошних тварей отлично ложится, как описание моего старшего братца иногда!"".  За это время я вспоминай что взрывчатка хорошо кидай. И много стало проща чем крысу зажарить! А там уже не гляди как к Ги Бейтзу попадай на приема. Тута мой игрок-с опять бранись:
""Из-за фикса 1.3 часть ключевых разговоров стали обрываться и намертво зависать. Пора искать новый фикс и для этого, бл*ть!!!"". Но решения он быстро находи на том жа первый сайте. Хотя моя его не понимает - там же положи весь этаж с Гейтсом и охраной, двери бум-бах! и Вота тебе и ответы квеста. Че с нима разговоры водить?! А охрана во дворах и на первом этаже глухая - хоть всех поубивайс - не прибежит, не заметит!

И так худа, да тормазно. С потеряй еще 4-5 ключевых разговора и делай по моя разумений - я все проходис! Всех поубивай, под зад злым увальням надавай! Деньгу получил и имел уважение! Многа-многа понравийся мне такой игра!
Но пора переходить к заключений от игрокс: ""Игра полна багов, неожиданных тормозов, подгрузок, своеобразного юмора, который (к их чести) реально пытались перевести в багованном фиксе 1.3, на который все молятся. Но честное слово - не будь это воспоминание о детстве. С фоллачевскими рофлами. Режимом ""всех казни - один останься, нам по*рать!"". И, конечно же, своеобразными диалогами при минимум интеллекта у персонажа (как я изобразил выше) - я бы скорее эти скидочные 120 рублей спустил на бутыль Пепси. И она, стакан за стаканом, отправилась бы растворять мой желудок с куда большим удовольствием, чем я дал бы их Габену за эти 0% стараний. Вот после такой халтуры еще бы кто-то вдавался в лицемерию против целевого игрового пиратства или ""раздач"" Эпика, который все еще пытается выживать на фоне Стима?!"".

В общем: 4 раза когда ты помнишь что игра на крепкую 8ку из 10 раз, когда от этой 8ки начинают кусок за куском отрывать баллы, оптимизацию, работоспособность и фпс прямо на твоих глазах. 

P.S. Арканум всегда в нашей памяти! Но вот этому набору ""собери сам за свои же деньги"" я более этого и не поставлю. Палец вверх только в память о Тройка Геймс.

"По сути Arcanum это брат Fallout 1-2, только от мира стимпанк, пусть фанаты перечисленных игр не будут судить меня за такое сравнение. Они одни из лучших RPG созданные в игрострое. Верно говорят, что такие игры ПОЧТИ больше не делают. И объясню почему: 

1. Ненавязчивый отыгрыш - ты волен выбрать что сделать, куда пойти, что сказать, кого убить и т.п., но в рамках игровых условностей и законов, разумеется. Как пример: хочешь открыть запертую дверь, но не можешь ее взломать? Расхерачь ее своим топором или взорви ее динамитом нахрен! Или тебе не понравился тот трусоватый констебль, который не хочет выполнять свою работу, пожалуйста, вломи ему посильнее, но когда на его крики сбегутся его стражники, будь готов огрести уже сам.
2. Твой уникальный персонаж - он не ограничен единственно возможным путем развития для достижения своей цели, как к примеру латник с мечом и щитом не владеющий луком или магией , или маг тупо кастующий определенную школу магии так-как нужно было выбрать только одну из четырех школ. Нет, создайте латника с винтовкой или с тем же луком, бафайте себя защитными аурами и улучшениями силы и ловкости, или мага почти со всеми заклинаниями из 16ти! школ магии. Да хотя-бы создайте мини армию из спутников и призванных орко-огров и элементалей, пустите их в атаку, а сами стойте и смотрите как они устраивают шоу. Поверьте, создать таких персонажей достаточно легко, если у вас есть время и желание.
3. Охерительные диалоговая система - не зря я сравнил Arcanum с Fallout-ами 1-2, в этом смысле они как близнецы. Вариантов ответов в разговоре много, тут надо реально вчитываться в ту фразу которую ты хочешь сказать НПЦ, ответил в середине долгого разговора не так - получи ухудшения отношения, оскорбил - спровоцировал драку. Отвечал как надо - тебя пропустили в новую локу не взяв с тебя ни монетки, так еще и накинули сверху. :) Кстати в фразах на проверку убеждения нет НИКАКОЙ индикации (какой у меня должен быть навык убеждения что-бы заболтать этого бандита? ДА ХЗ ВООБЩЕ!?), поэтому если хотите ""хорошо проведенных"" диалогов приготовьтесь почаще молится богу Сохранений.
4. Неизьеженный сеттинг - да, что не говори а у таких RPG получается создать интересный лор и ламповую атмосферу. В мире стимпанка, со своими технологиями и оружием аля XIX век, прекрасно уживаются эльфы со своей древней, но до сих пор могущественной магией, или орки и огры (полуорки и полуогры) такие же диковатые, больше напоминающие уличных бандитов из индустриальной эпохи. Тут есть и маленькие поселки с уютными тавернами как из любой фентези вселенной; большие города со столбами с газовыми лампами и указателями длинных улиц а так-же МЕТРО!!!, а есть подземелья будто пришедшие из Diablo или тупо алтари стоящие в казалось бы в пустынном месте на карте, которая как я вам скажу достаточно немаленькая.

Конечно, есть и причины по которым советовать поиграть в Arcanum не нужно.
Это изометрическая RPG с устаревшей графикой и эффектами, достаточно медитативная и не очень экшонистая если кому-нибудь хочется именно такого от ролевой игры. У Arcanum серьезный порог вхождения - не владеющим ""хотя-бы"" базовыми понятиями в устройстве RPG механик лучше не пробовать - поберегите свои нервы :). Достаточно деревянное управление - в бою начиная с 5-6 НПЦ можно случайно мискликнув по союзнику сагрить его или проюзать каст не на того и т.п. Сюда же входит не очень интуитивный интерфейс!
Если вы вышколенный ролевик - вы либо уже играете-играли в Arcanum, либо может думаете стоит начинать? Я думаю хотя-бы попытаться поиграть в нее сейчас стоит.
[u]Отдельно обращу внимание на стимовскую версию - она очень кривая. Поэтому все-таки придется потратить чуток нервов - покупаем игру и идем залатывать дыры, в мастерскую Steam за Arcanum Multiverse Edition![/u]

В-общем просто хотел бы подписаться под уже написанными обзорами этой игры, думаю другой человек мог бы добавить что-то еще и он бы я думаю не разу не соврал.

P.S. Спасибо за обзор от Edward Wolf-а, (смотрел в 2019) еще одна хорошая игра в личную коллекцию.
Arcanum понравился сразу, но чет подзадушили первая лока и дух мачкинства с постоянными пересозданиями перса, поэтому скипнул в свое время.
Но я частенько вспоминал про Arcanum, и вот недавно начал погружение. Создал ""идеального"" героя поэтому пока делаю что хочу, иду все дальше и интерес просыпается.

The game is really slow and it lags so bad you end up dying a lot which is really frustrating. I used to love this game on disk and now I am starting to not like the downloaded version. If you save frequently it seems to help a bit but do not try to leave the Arcanum game and go back to it as it will lag really bad and you have to close it down completely and re load it just to play. I am regretting spending the money on the purchase of this download at least  with a disk it did not LAG and make you constantly close out and reopen.,0,1,0,0,0,2021-02-06,2021-02-06,0,1,967,768

"Best cRPG ever made and here is why:

- Great and original ambience and setting, medieval colonial vs technology (gunpowder, energy, engines)
- Amazing story with great characters
- Living world with npc routines
- Freedom of choice with real consequences in the world
- You can role play your char with a freedom no other game has managed to do
- Char creation is deep in stats and it will totally change how you'll progress in the game

Other things that this game does really good:

- magic schools, lots of magic and progression on each school
- crafting, technology and items
- great voice acting on main npcs
- the music is amazing

Standard things:
- combat is as any other cRPG, although you can toggle if going turn based or in real time

So, is there some negative?
Well... I can only say time did leave graphics a little dated, but still looks artistically good.

It is (if not THE greatest) one of the best cRPGs of all times.

Drogi/droga Czytelniku/Czytelniczko.
Witam Cię w retro recenzji gry- Arcanum: Przypowieść o Maszynach i Magyi. Gry cRPG, w rzucie izometrycznym, stworzonej w 2001 roku przez Troika Games.
Przyjemniej lektury. 

[h1][i]Pierwsze wrażenie: 19/30[/i][/h1]
Ustrzegając się złudnemu poczuciu nostalgii i mimo upływu lat, oraz faktu, iż ostatnio odświeżyłem sobie tenże tytuł. Nie wiem, do czego ( nawet biorąc pod uwagę obecne realia growe ) porównywać grę Sierry. Niektórzy mówią, że jest podobna do Fallout'ów od Black Isle, inni starają się znaleźć pokrewieństwa z takimi tytułami jak Planetscape: Torment czy Baldur's Gate. 
Mnie jednak wydaje się, że jest to świat wprost wyrwany z systemu Shadow Run- tylko o jakieś sto lat starszy. Istotnie, do tego klimatu bardziej pasują książki Louis'a Stevenson'a czy Julius'a Verne'a, a może stary Londyn z lekka holmes'owskim przymrużeniem oka i czającym się Kubą Rozpruwaczem?
Arcanum to skrzyżowanie steam-punk'owej technologii z magią. Ale technologii starej, z czasów rewolucji przemysłowej, kiedy maszyny otaczane były kultem, a szczegóły ich konstrukcji miękko zaginały płaszczyzny secesji i art deco ( owszem, jest taki Elex, co łączy magię z technologią, jednak Arcanum robiło to lepiej i z wyczuciem ). 
Zdecydowanie, Arcanum to świat wyjątkowy, spójny jednak zbyt wcześnie na konkluzje.

[h1][i]Fabuła: 11/15[/i][/h1]
Lecisz sobie spokojnie Zeppelinem LF.S Zefir w bliżej nieznanym celu. Nagle dwa jednopłatowce, przypominające pilotowane przez orków Czerwone Barony, zaczynają strzelać do sterowca. Huk, rumor, rejwach i tumult. Piękny, lekki statek powietrzny wali się na ziemię w postaci poskręcanego metalu. Ty jeden/jedna wyszedłeś/wyszłaś cało. W szczątkach sterowca przygnieciony belką gnom wciska Ci w garść pierścień i mówi, ""znajdź chłopca"". 
Po tej wyczerpującej tyradzie umiera i w tym momencie pojawia się obok Ciebie pewien gadatliwy nieznajomy. Ów człek, zowie się Virgil i twierdzi, iż jesteś reinkarnacją jakiegoś Nasrudina- wszechpotężnego elfa.
Od tej chwili zaczynasz mieć istną manie prześladowczą. Ścigają Cię i knują przeciw Tobie wszyscy dookoła, z jakichś przyczyn pragną zdobyć pierścień gnoma i zabić każdego, kto przeżył kraksę LF.S Zefir.
Tak oto, rozpoczyna się Twoja przygoda niesamowitym świecie Maszyn i Magyi.

[h1][i]Audiowizualia: 10/15[/i][/h1]
Niesprawiedliwością byłoby opisywać grafikę z przed dwóch dekad, w nawiązaniu do dzisiejszej mocy akceleratorów graficznych. 
I w prawdzie można się zadumać czy tekstury prezentowane w nie-dzisiejszych rozdzielczościach, są tym, co tygryski lubią najbardziej? Niemniej ujmę to filozoficznie, jak szczwany cadyk z Radomska- ""A komu to przeszkadza?"". 
Co zaś tyczy się oprawy audio. Z niekłamaną przyjemnością, ponownie wsłuchiwałem się kompozycji na wiolonczelę i przeróżnych smyczków. Kameralna, melancholijna i zapadająca w pamięć uczta, dla kowadełek, młoteczków, ślimaczków i bębenków. Taki romantyczny wehikuł czasu, do lat po przemysłowego prosperity i kolonializmu. Chapeau bas.

[h1][i]Mechaniki: 9/10[/i][/h1]
Mam rzecz jasna, na myśli mechanikę gry. Rozgrywka zaś dostępna jest na trzech poziomach trudności. Interface nie jest skomplikowany choć powiem szczerze- za każdym razem musiałem się do na nowo przyzwyczajać. 
Jak w każdym RPG-u, tak i w Arcanum tworzysz bohatera/bohaterkę. Możesz skorzystać z bazy gotowych z własną, skrótową biografią ( 12 sztuk ). Wybrane biografie definiują nie tylko podst. statystki jak siła, inteligencja, zręczność etc. a również ekwipunek i zasobność sakiewki.
Do dyspozycji masz 8 ras ( człowiek, krasnolud, elf, półelf, niziołek, gnom, półork, półogr ). Wspomniana biografia postaci to dotychczasowa jej historia i kariera, której opisy są dość barwne i klimatyczne, zatem na pewno znajdziesz coś dla siebie. 
Jeśli jednak chcesz, Twoja postać może wystąpić jako tabula rasa, a Twoja przeszłość będzie tym, co zdarzy się w przyszłości. Później przyjdzie pora na czary-mary z punktami, które rozdzielasz na cztery kategorie: mechaniczne, bojowe, złodziejskie i socjalne.
Oprócz tego, możesz inwestować w liczne szkoły magii, a jest ich ponad 16. Każdy z nich zawiera 5 czarów.
Zaklęcia wymagają określonej liczby punktów wytrzymałości i punktów ( rzecz jasna ) many. Jak zatem widać, magia nie została tu potraktowana po macoszemu, a jest alternatywną dyscypliną rozwoju postaci. W niczym nie ustępującej nowoczesnej ( he, he ) technice. Ta ostatnia zaś dzieli się na 8 dziedzin, a te z kolei na 7 umiejętności, od klasycznego kowalstwa, po elektrostatykę rodem z najśmielszych projektów Nicola Tesli. Oczywiście istnieją dodatkowe schematy dla bardziej zaangażowanych majsterkowiczów ( medyczny, mechaniczny pajęczak <3 ).
Co do walki, może być ona rozgrywana na dwa sposoby: w czasie rzeczywistym, lub turowo. Pierwszy przypomina ten z Diablo, natomiast drugi, jest podobny do Fallout'ów ( dwóch ). Wykorzystujesz punkty akcji w zależności od zręczności postaci i prawdopodobieństwa trafienia, które z kolei zawisa od wprawnego posługiwania się orężem.
Wspomnę zdawkowo o towarzyszach, systemie nastawienia i z lekka o dialogach.
Sojusznicy mają karty postaci, takie same jak Twój bohater/bohaterka i w ten sam sposób rozwijają ich umiejętności. Nie możesz nimi sterować, acz ze wzgl. na dość wysokie SI, sami, mniej więcej wiedzą co robić. Każdy ma własny charakter, nie są jednowymiatowi. Osobiście, najlepszym kompanem był wg. mnie Pies. A to z uwagi na mistrzostwo w walce ( wręcz ) i jego brak reakcji na niegodziwe czyny herosa/heroiny.
A propos. 
Nastawienie NPC-e i kompanów zależy nie tylko od działań bohatera, a również od jego urody lub inteligencji. Tego do czego przykłada rękę ( ostrze, rewolwer lub kulę ognia ). Struktura quest'ów jest mało mówiąc- rozbudowana. Co też przekłada się na mnogość kwestii dialogowych w nich zawartych i kreatywnych ścieżek ich wykonywania. 
Ponad to wzorem z pierwszych Fallout'ów niska inteligencja sprawi, że postać wysławia się jak ( nie obrażając nikogo ) streamer.
[b]Ciekawostka:[/b] Dla postaci nastawionych stricte na magię, technologia będzie bezużyteczna. Dla kontrastu, biegli w technologii, nie skorzystają np. z zaklęć leczących. A zatem, jedno wyklucza drugie.

[h1][i]Trudność:7/10[/i][/h1]
To zależy od zrozumienia przez Ciebie mechanik, jak i obranie odpowiedniego bulidu. Mierz siły na zamiary, regularnie zapisuj stan gry.

[h1][i]Sterowanie: 6/10[/i][/h1]
Klawiatura plus mysz. :( Sorry, za ten lakoniczny wywód, zupełnie nie wiem co mogę dodać.

[h1][i]Długość 10/10[/i][/h1]
Pamięć już nie ta co kiedyś, dlatego pozwól, że poposiłkuję się twardymi danymi. Wg. serwisu ""howlongtobeat"", główny trzon fabularny zajmie Ci około 33,5 godziny. A pełny progres + zadania poboczne i dodatkowe aktywności, to nieco ponad 82 godziny.

[h1][i]Ogólny wynik: 72/100[/i][/h1]
Idea i realność, bajka i rzeczywistość, awers i rewers. Tych par nie da się pogodzić, jak nie da się złączyć magii i technologii. A jednak ponad 20 lat temu powstała gra, która paradoksalnie ujarzmiła te dwa bieguny. Baśniowe lasy entów i kominy fabryczne. Władca Pierścieni i 1890 Call of Cthulhu wg. Lovecrafta
Konkludując, myślę, iż Arcanum, choć nie tak głośny jak legendarne produkcje Czarnej Wyspy, to RPG-e z prawdziwego zdarzenia, gdzie wielkiej ilości dróg i ścieżek do przejścia, dorównuje tylko nieograniczoność rozwoju postaci. 
Gra, której głównym przesłaniem nie jest walka dobra ze złem. A walka marzeń z rzeczywistością. Tylko od CIEBIE zależy, co wygra. Ja wybrałem marzenie i dlatego długo jeszcze będę powracał do świata Arcanum.

"It took me a while before I finally approached to play this game. It's funny, since it was pretty high on my list because it was made by developers of two first Fallout games, which I consider to be one of the best CRPGs ever made. Unfortunately, Arcanum has aged unfavorably. Maybe in early 2000s it could be considered as a pretty good isometric RPG, but by today's standards it can be only considered as average, or even user unfriendly.

Our journey in Arcanum begins with a crash of an airship, which was assaulted for unknown reasons by a group of bandits in air fighters. Being the only one survivor of the crash, we have to find a reason why it happened and who is responsible for it. To solve the mystery, the only thing we have is an advice of a dying man: ""find a boy and give him this ring. It's all up to you, my friend"". And then, we are moving out for our quest. Main storyline has all what it should have: there's a mystery, there is a secret assassin society, there are wrong and good choices, even few interesting plot twists. As for the main quest - not only I found it properly done, but it also assured me that developers of the game were capable of creating pretty interesting storyline and lore. They also gave us a plenty of possibilities for creating a character: warrior, mage, archer, gunslinger etc. The character creator menu can be overwhelming at the start. The best way to understand it is to just play a game, so better be ready that you might start all over again to upgrade your skills effectively.

This open world has over 80 locations to visit: bigger towns, smaller towns, camps, caves, islands, ruins, castles and many others. Exploring the world won't make them easy to find, since they does not appear on the world map even if our route goes next to it, and it's a huge flaw in my opinion. Original Fallouts had no such problem for example, because locations became visible to us when we moved nearby. In Arcanum, in most cases we will find out the specifics about visiting places through dialogues. Unfortunately, even if someone will tell us about certain locations and we will visit them, not many of them will be interesting. Also, exploring them can be a time consuming quest. Most of the buildings in Arcanum cities and villages look exactly the same, there is no recognition points to find our way around, and because of that at the beginning of the game it's very easy to get lost in large cities. To make exploring easier for us, developers gave names to most of the streets in the game, but it seems more like a design laziness. Architecture in a world of magic and machines (since it's steampunk) should give to the developers a lot of space for artistic expression, but this aspect of the game was not treated with the attention it deserves. World of Arcanum - despite all of its potential - lacks artistic uniqueness and brings no emotions to the player through its visuals.

One of the biggest problems of this game is its illegibility: it lacks of deeper interaction with its world and characters. A simple icon of eyeglass, a possibility of taking a closer look at the environement (terrain, objects, characters) to see its better description would be a great improvement in a game that uses 2D graphics. Yet, it isn't there, neither the situation-log (like Pip Boy 2000 from Fallout games). For this reason, specifics of the world around us are very poor. Of course we can find books throughout our journey that could explain the nature of Arcanum to us, but I am talking about actual options of experiencing its world right here and right now. The fact that areas are big and full of different objects and characters, it's a shame that a player does not get proper tools to explore it and manipulate through it. Illegibility creates a compulsion that pushes us to ask all the questions and speak with as many NPCs as we can. As it seems pretty cool in the beginning - since the dialogues in RPGs are important - the result is not enjoyable at all. ""More"" not always means ""better"". Arcanum gives us a liberty to speak with almost every character in the game (you can also kill everyone if you want), but not many of NPCs has something interesting to say. 90% of dialogues in this game concentrates around asking about news in town, trading, looking for a way somewhere or playing dice. There is nothing interesting in such dialogues at all, and at some point in the game we are starting to figuring out which NPCs might have something interesting to say. In most cases there is no way to distinguish which characters are important and which ones are useful only to show us the way; the only option is to talk with all of them, and find out for ourselves. Usually in RPGs you can't speak with everybody, but when you finally meet a NPC that you can talk to, dialogue with him most probably will reward you with information, quest, his story, he might share his personal feelings about the in game world. Unfortunately, dialogues in Arcanum are not interesting at all. If we are patient enough to look through all the NPCs on the screen, someone finally will give us a quest or information about important people's whereabaouts. Until we find them, we can start to feel overwhelmed by size of the world of Arcanum.

Side-quests themselves are mostly fetch-ones: bring me this, bring me that, which should be expected. What bothers me, is that the main story quests are a proof that developers are capable of creating interesting scenarios, yet in a world of this size (I will repeat: there's over 80 locations that we can visit) there is not so many side quests that might be interesting. The ones I remembered the most were the ""Ghost of Bessie Toone"" and the one with mastering melee combat (there's a sad love story involved).

The last aspect of the game that I will speak of is its combat: it's not balanced properly! We can choose between turn-based or real-time mode - we change it by pressing space. The beginning of the game might be tough (I've played on hard difficulty as half elve) and we can have a really hard time with the bandits, especially when it comes to hand in hand combat, but it's normal: we need more experience, more equipement, good companions. But even if we level up pretty well and we are managing to take care of ourselves and our crew, one of the main quests will take us to the location where we will have to fight with several golems. At this point of the game most of the players should be confused, since not only our weapon breaks on them, but also they kill us with a few hits, so it should be good to keep them on distance, but if throughout your game you wanted to create a melee-based character: you're in trouble. Watch out, because Black Mountains are the most annoying part of the game. It gets a lot easier with magic (I recommend [SPOILER]harm spell or pyrotechnic axe[/SPOILER]). There's more: fighting can be pretty messy, since our characters are dropping very often their weapons. It happens mostly in real-time combat mode, that after few moments we realize that one of our characters is fighting using bare hands and we have no idea where he or she lost its weapon - our companions, nor our protagonist have no self preservation instinct to pick it up automatically without our direct order. Basically, a challenge of combat in this game was over for me when I have found a strong companion (spoiler: [spoiler]a dog[/spoiler]). And with that much of a force in my team, no enemy, no bandit and no boss was no longer a problem.

To be finished: I can't recommend this game. Of course it can still find its fans, maybe some old-school & hardcore RPG players will find it interesting, but for me it just aged pretty badly. It has its pros, but they are dissapearing in the blackness of dull dialogues, non-balanced combat and uninteresting locations. 5/10.",0,1,0,10,2,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,348,21,1898,1898

"If only I could show you the places I have seen, you might understand the things I say. I have been to the Desolate Lands, wandered by those souls who still see the lands of the living but wear the cloak of the dead. Blind to their own ends, they cry, passing through one another like shadows in the dying light of day. I have travelled to where souls rot in torment, pierced with the jagged shards of life and vision, clinging to memory - regrets of the flesh. I saw that this prison was of their own making, and that the key was in unknowing, in release... and still, I travelled on. And finally, I came to the place where souls go to die. Where the mirrored and worn spirits fall into an endless sea of grey, mirrored glass... and I lowered myself within... and lay among them... and I almost did not return. And do you know what I found there? There, among the silent and battered shells of the innumerable? Peace. Enlightenment. Truth. Only then I realized that this place, this ""Life"", is an abomination, a horrible distortion of the natural order.

This ""Life"", who mothered Pain, and Fear, and Envy - these twisted children who exist only because we are here to feed them, to nourish them. This ""Life"", this... afterthought - a disturbance, a mere ripple in that great, dead sea, not even the cause, but merely an effect, sending these souls upwards, screaming for release from the day they are torn from their waters! The effect of what! I do not know. Nor do I care.

I see your soul, traveler. It screams, tattered and spent. Do you feel its pull? Do you hear its wailing? It is within my power to calm these waters, and that is what I shall do.

Have you ever spoken with the dead? Called to them from this side, pulled them from their silent rest? Do you know what it is that they feel? Pain.

"It's a classic RPG from some of the same guys that made Fallout. Yes, it's good. Lots of quests, rich dialog and some potential plot twists, freedom to do good or evil, and a deep character development system. RPG fans will like it. 

I'm still in the early stages but having a good time. However, there are some quirks. 
- The game makes you run all over the the place and it's pretty grueling to keep tracking back and forth across the map. The maps seem to let you run forever if you want; there's no clear delineation of a border where you can then move to the world map. The game does show it, but you have to watch for the map icon to change; then you can move onto the larger map. 

- The game doesn't always do a good job of letting you know what you should be doing next. In some ways, that's part of the strength, it's letting you choose your own adventure, but in others it can be frustrating. 

Update 2020-Dec-24: Merry Christmas to you. I have an update. After upgrading my system to a dual monitor setup (with two monitors that are better than the one I used before), I can no longer run Arcanum. I'm not sure if this is because there are two monitors, if it's because both are higher resolution than the old monitor, or if it's because the two monitors are different resolution. I could probably disconnect one of the monitors and see if it runs that way, but instead I'll probably just wait for the modders to eventually fix the issue. I still think this is a great game and want to play it, but there are too many games in the backlog that don't require hassles, so that's what it'll be for now. If I get really inspired, I will install Arcanum on a second PC with just one monitor or maybe a laptop. 

- You don't really know when you're level-appropriate for an encounter. The way you find out is to die. Again, that may be a function of the game's openness, but even though they're a bit more restricting, there is something to be said for zone control that lets you move to areas when you're ready and save you some reloads. 

- The in-game knowledge sharing is a bit weak. You really have to read the manual or a faq. There aren't tool tips on interface controls where you'd like them, and I played the first part of the game not really understanding what I'm supposed to do with the balance between magic and technology, which is one of the game world's foundational pieces. 

- Would it have killed them to make the early stores have a lockpick set for sale?

- Inventory management is pretty old school. And it sure would have been nice to have had some hints about ""Yeah, that stuff's useless, you can sell it,"" and ""That item will be really useful if you're going to craft as a wizard (or techie) so keep it."" Yes, I know it's an old game, but a legit criticism is a legit criticism. 

- Apparently the game has issues with modern operating systems. Thankfully, good effort by modders has led to patches that will not just make the game playable but even better. Check these out for sure, and thanks to the modders!",1,0,0,0,0,2020-11-30,2020-12-24,0,108,638,537

"[h1] Знакомство [/h1]
Сразу скажу, что игра на 2 года старше меня. Узнал я про нее из этого видео https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41OMMYP2swo&t=1s&ab_channel=EdvardWolf. Когда посмотрел на цену игры сразу же приобрел, так как по словам автора это была и остается одна из лучших РПГ в в принципе. Сразу скажу, что я судить не могут так как из CRPG играл только в DOS 2. 
Игра меня встретила меня главным в котором играла главная тема игры. И странным образом этот квартет из скрипки, виолончели и чего-то еще сразу же создает атмосферу уюта. Сразу можно выделить плюс - [u] саундтрек игры [/u]. В нем не так много треков и может кому-то они покажутся одинаковыми, но качество у всех лично мне показалось очень высоким. Теперь стим-панк будет ассоциироваться у меня только с этой мелодией из главного меню. Когда же я зашел в игру то она жутко тормозила для игры 2001 года и нельзя было нормально скролить камеру. Впрочем это все фикситься очень просто и даже в обсуждениях полно гайдов от фанатов игры которые фиксят недочеты игры. Тут можно выделить и второй плюс - [u] Комьюнити игры [/u]. Причем именно с заглавной буквы, ведь игра до сих пор поддерживается ее преданными фанатами. Встречал 2 интересных сборок модов с которыми можно перепройти игру и получить совершенно новый игровой опыт. 
И так пофиксил неисправности, и начал игру. Поиграл минут сорок и вырубил. Тут всплывает [u] минусик [/u], возможно из-за моей машины или это можно как-то пропатчить, но после выхода все цвета на мониторе становятся ярче, что после не самой яркой палитры игры делает больно глазу.

[h1] Неприятие [/h1]
Такие ролевки лично меня затягивают с трудом, хотя я пробовал только лучшие(DOS2/arcanum), насколько я слышал. Эта игра не стала исключением. Но на опыте который я получил из DOS2 я знал что нужно просто перетерпеть какой-то момент. Что же, однозначно хорошее решение. Еще один [u] минус [/u] - это интерфейс игры. Не то как он оформлен, так как визуально он выглядит очень даже подходяще и оригинально, но чтобы в нем разобраться современному игроку придется попотеть. А про возможность ломать сундуки я узнал только случайно кликнув на F2. Хотя к игре прилагается мануал со всем разъяснениями, который я даже прочел немножечко, но сделал я это уже после того как разобрался что к чему. 
Могу отметить еще [u] минус игры для новичка и плюс для опытного дяди [/u] - боевка. Я узнал о том что можно переключаться между риал тайм и пошаговым боем только на часу 30 игры. И то только потому что прочитал об этом в одном из отзывов(да я читаю отзывы об играх после того как уже начал играть, не осуждайте меня). Но разобравшись в ней можно придумать несколько тактик и в теории все могут сработать. Я например и выманивал по 1, и бегал кругами от более медленных врагов, и ставил динамит под себя засекал таймер в тот же момент и приманивал врагов ровно в тот момент когда он заденет их но меня не заденет. Все эти тактики можно приписать к общему геймплею, так как ими может ползоваться как маг так и технолог, но так как я салага в этой игре, эти тактики мои основные. К слову о магах и технологах, сразу выделятся жирнющий плюс - [u] ролевая система [/u]. Хочешь собрать технолога или мага? пффф да такое каждый 2 собирает, хочешь всю игру быть соблазнительно красоткой и добиваться своих целей через секс? Да запросто! Хочешь быть одним из тех ребят, у которых язык настолько развязан, что они могут уболтать кого-угодно. ООО ДА! При этом я не брал в расчет того что есть 18 или 16 школ магии в которых по 5 уровней заклинаний или около того. И все просто невозможно изучить тк макс лвл 50. Или школы технологии, которые имеют чуть меньшую вариативность типов но гораздо большую глубину изучения, тк к обычным школам еще добавляются схемы.
Что-то я отвлекся, если говорить в двух словах первые часов 20, пока со всем разбирался, шли трудно.

[h1] Осознание [/h1]
После 20 часа неплохой игры(просто неплохой), я начал осознавать, за что люди до сих пор так обожают arcanum. [u] Это мир игры, персонажи живущие в нем и диалоги с ними [/u]. Что же все по порядку.
Мир. Мир игры это что то по-настоящему уникальное, не потому что это стимпанк, а потому что это стимпанк с магией. И весь этот на первый взгляд бредовый сэттинг наполняет смыслом одно единственное, я бы даже сказал гениальное, правило - магия мешает технологии, технология мешает магии. Все, вот тебе и сюжетные конфликты, и разные билды в том числе и неиграбельные, и интересный сеттинг в придачу. По вечерам особенно приятно играть с мягким освещением как из главного меню, оооох эти звуки скрипок. На 2 часика пропасть из реального мира и поговорить с барменами о последних сплетнях, трахнуть овцу и прочая рутина.
Теперь можно перейти к персонажам. Я бы не сказал что каждый НПС тут уникален, да оно и правильно так как и в реальном мире полно одинаковых людей. Те НПС которые дают квесты никогда не говорят какую-то дичь, которая убивает всю атомсферу, руша всю логику своего существования. Такого я здесь не замечал. А те НПС которые озвучены - сюжетные НПС проработаны очень хорошо. Может и не все, но большинство. Особенно их озвучка - от нее я тащусь. Тот же Магнус, который во всю пытается показать какой он весь из себя дворф, но на самом деле просто обычный житель города, ничего не знающий о дворфьей культуре.
Хотя с Магнусом есть кое-какой баг. И баги тоже есть в этой игре, хоть их фиксят модами, хотя я моды не ставил, так что у меня был баг и я потерял 2 часа игрового времени. 
И наконец диалоги. Эххх, причиной почему я все таки решил написать отзыв послужил диалог. Диалог с бывшим королем гномов. И он как и во всех играх рассказывал мне ситуацию со своей перспективы, но в этой игре я не просто выслушал его предложения. Я услышал в них интересную мысль касающуюся сущности людей. Дело в том, что гномы в этой вселенной живут по 500 лет или около того, а люди как обычно. И этот срок, который выделен нам людям, порождает страх - страх смерти. Из-за этого люди вначале думают о выгоде, потом о последствиях, а после о чувствах себя и окружающих. Да мысль не уникально, НО наверняка о ней не так часто слышали или читали или видели в кино, а особенно в играх, где 500 лет и 80 лет сравнивают смысл своего бытья и все это логически обоснованно. В общем видно что игра делалась не дураками, и не для дураков, так как они и не оценили бы эту мысль. А всем кто дочитал до этого момента хочу пожелать 500 лет бытья и побольше таких игр!!!

The world itself is teeming with life and personality. I urge you to speak to every npc, complete every quest, read every book, and search every cave.

"Великая игра для своего времени. Проходить ее в 2020 году по собственному желанию будут не многие, либо за это дело возьмутся ностальгирующие старички, которые играли во время выхода.

Пожалуй, начну с недостатков:
1. Оптимизация. ""Чистая"" версия из стим у меня на w10 не работала. Игра запускалась с инверсией цветов и в негативе. Разрешение было 800 на 600 и отсутствовал курсор. Для того, чтобы пройти игру пришлось установить большой патч, который полностью менял ее, но позволял запустить на современных платформах. Найти его можно в обсуждениях. Но даже с оптимизированной версией по ходу прохождения были подтормаживания и подгрузки. Меня это не сильно напрягало, но, я думаю, может бесить некотрых. Так же, как я понял, из-за обновления патча игра полностью сломалась на последнем экране прохождения, и мне пришлось смотреть концовки на ютубе. 
2. Отсутствие озвучки, большое количество текста. Этот недостаток напрямую связан с временем выхода игры, ведь ей уже почти 20 лет. Даже при условии установки большого патча с русификацией всех текстов, по русски озвучены только заставки и мы можем слышать некоторых НПС, но уже на английском. Все остальные квестовые задания, диалоги, записки, описания предметов и прочее приходится читать самостоятельно.
3. Сложность. Этот пункт отмечу для тех людей, кто решиться проходить эту игру в первый раз как и я. Огромное количество навыков, классов, специализаций, оружия сильно сбивает с толку в начале игры. Когда вы уже освоитесь (примерно к середине), то скорее всего обнаружите огромное количество недостатков в вашей раскачке, что приведит к постоянному сейвскаму локаций. Так же заложенные разработчиком системы автоматической прокачки, как по мне, являются неоптимальными, что опять возвращает к изучению вдоль и поперек своего персонажа. Еще одним недостатком является отсутствие прямых подсказок и помощи, на интересные дополнительные квесты можно просто случайно натыкаться, либо целенаправленно идти к ним исходя из опыта предыдущего прохождения.
Геймплей. Если пренебрегать сюжетом, то весь геймплей сводиться к постоянным сражениям или их избеганию. Пошаговый боевой режим, который с середины игры я использовал постоянно, скорее всего покажется скучным и оттолкнет от себя игроков. Так же процесс перемещения по огромной но все-таки пустоватой карте будет докучать.

Теперь опишу основные достоинства, которыми покорила меня эта игра:

1. Сюжет. Хорошо проработанный, фантастический, мрачноватый сюжет захватывает с самого начала. Стимпанк перемешанный с магией, в который вас забрасывают без всяких объяснений. Застой, накаленность отношений, витающая в воздухе неприязнь, лицемерие и неидеальность мира добавляет реализма вселенной, и ты начинаешь в нее верить. Большим подспорьем являются ваши союзники, с собственной историей и секретами; они позволяют раскрыть атмосферу Арканум. Изучать мир в их компании становиться гораздо интереснее. Еще доставляет удовольствие огромное количество дополнительных заданий, которые позволяют узнать больше информации о вселенной Арканума или даже повлиять на итоговую концовку. Главная история показалась мне нетипичной с неожиданными сюжетными поворотами; никогда не можешь предугадать что будет ждать после очередной сюжетной точки. Интерес подогревает необратимость некоторых действий (за исключением сейвскама), иногда приходится действовать очень оперативно, а в некоторых случаях требуется больше времени для анализа ситуации.
2. Большой открытый мир. Хоть я и обозначил в недостатках пустоватость карты. Я писал в первую очередь о ее общем виде. Локации городов и селений, а так же места выполнения дополнительных квестов уникальные и запоминающиеся. С интересом изучаешь все, что предоставляет тебе игра, пытаешься проникнуть во все потаенные места.
3. Вариативность. Многие задания можно выполнять разными способами исходя из вашей раскачки персонажа. Вы можете пойти напролом, убив всех оппонентов, либо воспользоваться даром убеждения, чтобы заполучить требуемую вещь добровольно, а можете ловко проникнуть за спину, оставшись незамеченным. Сложность будет представлять недостаточность развития навыка для того чтобы попасть в локацию, убедить персонажа и т.д.
4. Интересные загадки. Так же в противовес к скучному геймплею (сражения большую часть времени) хочу обозначить периодически встречающиеся загадки. В рамках жанра игры они выполнены достойно, заставляют поломать голову. Честно признаюсь, что некоторые головоломки я решал с помощью сторонних источников, так как не закален прохождениями старых игр.

Комментарий:
Арканум стал моей первой игрой жанра RPG и является для меня классическим его представителем. Я изначально знал, как будет выглядеть примерная игровая картина и был готов к прохождению. Приступил к игре в начале 2020 года, но, после двух месяцев, забросил ее, так как сам запорол сохранение. Во время трехмесячного перерыва часто вспоминал об Аркануме и чувствовал желание запустить игру снова. Во второй раз я приступил к прохождению уже с багажом первого неудачного прохождения. Игра затянула и не отпускала до самого конца.

"[h1]True old school RPG[/h1]
[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/38400/]Fallout 1[/url]/[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/38410/]2[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/466300/]Planescape: Torment[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/228280/]Baldur's Gate 1[/url]/[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/257350/]2[/url], [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/321800/]Icewind Dale 1[/url]/2 – пожалуй, первое, что приходит на ум при мыслях о давних лучших изометрических истинных RPG, но при этом часто незаслуженно забывают об [b]Arcanum[/b]...
Ведь если в определенный момент вам приедаются чистокровные фентезийные миры, то сабж даст новый взгляд на мир полный волшебства, но тесно соседствующего с технологий в жанре стимпанк. Для начала нулевых это был совсем не заезженный прием, да и добавлен он был не для галочки, а очень хорошо вписан в лор игры, основываясь на одном простом правиле: Магия и Технология взаимоисключают друг друга - магия работает против законов природы, в то время как технология подчиняется им. Что напрямую влияет не только на игровые сюжеты, но и на ролевую механику, например: вето на использование предметов - маг из пистолета скорей ногу себе прострелит, чем хоть раз попадет в противника, а для технолога бесполезны магические предметы; даже локации влияют на ваш счетчик 'направленности', когда сила заклинаний зависит от склонности к магии, то и ваша магическая эффективность в драке будет отличаться, от боя проходящего посреди поля до потасовки на каком-нибудь ж/д вокзале. Ролевая система изобилует деталями и микроправилами, заставляющими поверить в достоверность созданного мира. Привыкли, что к оружию и броне идут дефолтовые показатели урона/защиты с бонусами и без, и нужно просто выбирать шмотку покруче? а вот нет! на всё есть отдельные показатели и исходить нужно из специализации кем играете: вору не нужны шумные вещи; дипломату перед торговлей и важными переговорами лучше надеть ""малиновый пиджак"" на плюс к реакции собеседника; нашли крутой латный доспех, пожалуйста, можете надеть его даже на доходягу, игра это не запрещает, но броня будет весить столь много, что придется выкинуть всё из инвентаря, чтобы герой смог хотя бы передвигаться; гигантские полуогры не смогут пользоваться огнестрельным оружием, т.к. их пальцы-сосиски банально не пролазят в скобу, под которой находится спусковой крючок, зато из-за огромной силы могут играючи размахивать двуручным мечем даже одной рукой; хотите создать мага-дворфа, пожалуйста, как и многое в игре, всё упирается не в банальные запреты, а в эффективность пути, который вы придумали, такой вариант возможен, но будьте готовы, что расовый штраф на удвоенную цену заклинаний сводит на нет возможные преимущества. Что уж говорить про то, что Arcanum чуть ли не единственная CRPG, в которой реализована размерность брони и одежды, хорошо прописаны деление рас по социальной классовости, дискриминации по половому признаку и роду деятельности, ВСЕ квесты написаны вручную, что исключает побочки в стиле 'убей 3 орка' как факт, ну и ""стандартная"" возможность пройти игру с единичкой интеллекта и 'захватывающими диалогами'. И этот список можно продолжать и продолжать, сказать обо всем невозможно, лучше самому ознакомиться со всем этим в одной из [b]лучших RPG ever[/b].
[u][b]> Что же делает ее лучшей?[/b][/u] Созданная выходцами из [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Interplay%20Inc.]Interplay Inc.[/url], командой достаточно безумной, чтобы раздувать свои проекты до масштабов несопоставимых с ресурсами и возможностями, потому что именно Так выглядит разработка ведущаяся для Игроков, а не для заколачивания денег. Это попытка создать то что не оставит игроков равнодушными, позитивный посыл, полный энтузиазма и самоотдачи. Что в эпоху гриндилок с фермами и строительством базы, ставящих во главу угла фальш в наглости добавить уровни и вылетающие из противников циферки во все жанры, чтобы поскорей склонить игрока к покупке вон того элитного лука за доп.плату и самоуверенности именовать все это ""RPG-составляющей""... Ну а что до [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Troika%20Games]Troika Games[/url], они навсегда останутся теми сумасшедшими, создающими Шедевры сквозь боль, и Arcanum очень сродни их прошлому небезызвестному проекту (первому Fallout), только боевая система попроще (в техническом плане, но не в тактическом размахе). И самое главное тут, что это такая же нестандартная по сеттингу и глубоко прописанная игра представляющая игроку песочницу с безграничными возможностями для отыгрыша. Когда прохождение одного игрока будет отличаться от прохождения другого - не только манерой игры, но и в плане сценарных перипетий, и, благо, оба этих аспекта прописаны в игре на Максимальном уровне. А это ли не главное для Ролевой то игры?

"Arcanum is a world where magick and technology co-exist in perpetual competition. It's like Shadowrun in the 19th century. But instead of hacking you can become a technologist who can assemble firearms and explosive devices out of stuff found in garbage bins around cities. If you focus your training and become really good, you can make machineguns and powerful steam-powered machines that fight alongside you. Or you can be a sorcerer who throws fireballs and heals himself with blue magic lights... The choice is up to you, but the latter choice definitely sounds boring, you can do that in thousands of other games... :) 

The story, the dialogues are clever and really well written. The whole world is really charming and captivating, it is a big open world. Arcanum is the best RPG ever made, along with Fallout and Fallout 2. It's not for the modern players though, no quest markers and hand-holding typical for modern games. And that is also part of its greatness. If you like classic games and their complexity, you can't miss here.",1,1,0,2,0,2020-09-26,2020-09-26,0,118,4414,4360

"The closest you're ever going to get to a high-fantasy RPG in the style of classic Fallout: a majority of the same developers, same general approach to storytelling/worldbuilding, and and a good amount of shared mechanics implementation. All the elements are there, and in most of their accustomed places; there's just [i]more[/i] of it: more world map, more quests, more lore spread more evenly across more consistent story beats. It's almost what you'd expect Van Buren to have been, had Interplay not shot itself in the foot and nixed Black Isle's development of it.

Unfortunately, 'more stuff' also necessitates 'more stuff what can break' and Arcanum is nothing if not inclined to break. As other posters have noted, the widescreen fix and unofficial patch are absolutely essential on newer systems (and make sure you get the right version), and even then you'll run into the occasional glitched companion or hard crash in the second half. It's nothing you can't work around via the old 'save often and in different slots' mentality (especially as there are no autosaves), but it can be a little wearing when you enter Tulla and Virgil suddenly decides to polymorph into a random NPC for the sixth time that day.

Is it worth it? Absolutely, especially if you consider price vs. length of potential use. Will it take you a couple of restarts to figure out your preferred playstyle and acclimate yourself to the combat/magic/tech utility balance? Just like Fallout, yes. Is the story worth the occasional slog to get to it? Yes, though if you're finding yourself bogged down more by the combat or bugs that you were in similar titles, you'd be forgiven for just picking up where you left off in a YouTube walkthrough. 

Oh -- and a final note about the soundtrack: though it wouldn't be my first choice for a game like this (I prefer my fantasy pastoralism in Jack Wall or Jeremy Soule flavour), it is [i]objectively[/i] well-composed and worth a listen. It's a little heavy on the weepy violin in places, and the main theme ends up as a motif for way too many locations in-game, but the string-quartet style otherwise really suits the steampunk aesthetic.",1,1,0,0,0,2020-09-20,2020-09-20,0,11,7319,7319
"С Arcanum я знаком около 10 лет, в детстве про такую игру даже не слышал и в первый раз запустил, когда уже учился в университете. К тому моменту за моими плечами был 12-летний геймерский стаж. На тот момент я уже был преданым фанатом серии Fallout и Vampire masquerade, но про Арканум случайно услышал от одного фаната, который постоянно расхваливал игру. 

Итак, какова была моя первая реакция при запуске Арканума? Резкое неприятие.
Почему? Потому что здесь сошлись почти все раздражающие меня элементы. Экран создания персонажа с кучей параметров и характеристик, о значении которых ты ничего не знаешь, убогая картинка, рудиментарная детсадовская боёвка, неудобный интерфейс и тучи всевозможных правил и микроправил, о которых ты не имеешь никакого понятия. 
Однако я решил дать игре шанс. В итоге я, переборов первоначальный отталкивающий импульс, погрузился в мир Арканума и он мне понравился. 

Во-первых, из-за сеттинга, я сам увлекаюсь историей/культурологией, поэтому викторианская эпоха в сочетании с фэнтези и стимпанком мне тут же полюбилась. Даже до сих пор подчёркнуто вежливая и построенная на формулах 19-го века речь, особенно когда дело доходит до оскорблений, меня очень сильно веселит. Стилизация, на мой взгляд, довольно удачная.

Во-вторых, здесь реально есть пространство для отыгрыша, можно разными путями решать тот или иной квест, быть злобным или добрым, расистом или либералом, капиталистом или пролетарием, всегда можно выбрать свои манеру речи и поведение.

В-третьих, сами идеи, которые лежат в основе квестов и лора, очень и очень привлекательны. Если превратить Arcanum в книгу, то вышел бы приключенческий роман-детектив, который бы стал бомбой для читающей публики 19-го века. Здесь собраны, пожалуй, все жанры, тропы и приёмы, господствовавшие в тогдашней литературе. С этой точки зрения, Arcanum представляет собой уникальное явление, по-настоящему способное дать представление о людях и атмосфере позапрошлого столетия. Вальтера Скотта, Диккенса и прочих золотых авторов 19-го века читают очень мало, а данный проект может возбудить интерес к данному культурному пласту. Короче говоря, Arcanum - игра интеллигентная.

Вот три причины, по которым я рекомендую данный проект. Вот почему игра до сих пор вызывает у меня интерес и я 4 раза пытался её пройти (но не прошёл ни разу, потому что она довольно большая и в процессе может просто пропасть интерес).

В остальном, особенно в техническом отношении, это игра-уродец. 
- Я знаю историю её разработки и как компания обанкротилась, но мне, как потребителю, на это плевать, мне важен продукт. Сделан продукт очень плохо. Напомню, что первый Fallout вышел в 1997-ом году, а Arcanum в 2001-ом. При этом Arcanum устроен куда более архаично первого Фоллача. 
Игра страдает болезнью рпг того времени с квестами в духе ""пойди туда, не знаю куда. Ничего хорошего я в этом не вижу и считаю серьёзным недостатком, отпугивающим от игры людей, которые могли бы стать её фанатами. 
- Боёвка в Fallout была тоже совершенно нулевой, надо было просто стоять и палить из всего своего арсенала, ожидая либо своей смерти, либо гибели соперника, но в Arcanum боёвка... она просто есть. Она не взрывает пятую точку, не раздражает, она не построена на рандоме. Она настолько схематичная и жалкая, что я даже не могу на неё обижаться. Это как кричать на младенца, за то, что тот не умеет танцевать вальс.  Я сам уверен, что боёвку прикрутили сюда просто для того, чтобы она была. Удовольствие от прохождения она испортить не способна. А персонажи, буквально запинывающие потерявшего сознание врага, это невероятно смешное зрелище. 
- Авторы Arcanum умудрились даже сломать перемещение по карте. О чём это я? Да о том, что переместиться вы можете только на несколько метров, потом надо нажимать кнопку мыши ещё раз и ещё раз до тех пор, пока вы не доберётесь до нужной вам точки. Найти на локации нужное вам место и переместить туда болванчиков одним нажатием мыши, если болванчики стоят слишком далеко, нельзя.
- Баги. За все эти годы ситуация с багами почти не улучшилась. До сих пор в игре происходит необъяснимая шизофреническая дичь. Например, по пути на задание, зайдя в магазин, я потерял Вирджила. Куда он делся я так и не понял, однако из спутников он не пропал. Оказалось, что он каким-то образом тупо переместился сквозь стену в соседнее помещение, где находятся личные покои торговца. При любой попытке вскрыть замок и зайти в ту комнату на меня тут же агрились и торговец и офицеры. Пришлось химичить с отмычками и скрытностью. Второй случай - моего спутника-огра запинали враги и он без сознания лежал на земле (не мертвый). Я решил, что пусть он полежит, отдохнёт, а я схожу сдам квест в соседнем доме. Только я подошёл ко входу в здание, как запустился боевой режим. Почему? Сперва я ничего не понял, я же ни на кого не агрессировал, не воровал, не убивал мирных граждан, в чём же дело?
А дело в том, что за те несколько секунд, что я бежал до соседнего дома, в области, где лежал мой огр, из ниоткуда заспавнились несколько бандитов, которые начали издеваться над моим спутником. Поэтому пришлось спешно бежать обратно и несколько раз перезагружаться, потому что за это время огра успевали убить. Третий случай - во время моего самого первого прохождения, а к тому моменту я наиграл часов 15, игра просто побила мои сохранения, наглухо. Можете представить мою реакцию. 
- Без гайдов играть в Arcanum бесполезно. Это одна из тех игр, которая требует знания множества тонкостей (конфликт магии и технологии, за что отвечают параметры, какие заклинания и технологии хороши, а какие нет etc), без которых вы легко запорете себе билд и в какой-то момент начнёте страдать. Описания довольно скупые, поэтому сама игра не способна себя объяснить.

Иными словами, Arcanum - это удивительная идея, которой не нашлось достойного воплощения. То, что мы имеем, это сырая заготовка, которую требовалось бы ещё минимум годик шлифовать и дорабатывать. При каждом сеансе игры в Arcanum меня не покидает ощущение хрупкости всего, что я вижу. Такое ощущение, что игра в любой момент может рассыпаться на атомы, настолько она условная и неуклюжая. 
Но почему же тогда я рекомендую этот проект, спросите вы?
Потому что у этого проекта есть обаяние, отвечу я.  Мне его жаль, я сочувствую ему и понимаю, что при должном финансировании мог получиться шедевр. Авторам, всё же, удалось претворить в жизнь этот сложный проект, удалось вложить в него тонну контента. Удовольствия от Arcanum можно получить очень много. Поэтому я ни в коем случае не желаю восторгаться игрой, я ей сочувствую и снисходительно отношусь ко всем её шероховатостям и недоработкам. К этому же и призываю тех, кто ещё её не проходил, но услышал от кого-то, что это игра-эпоха. Отнеситесь к данному проекту со снисхождением, он действительно этого заслуживает. 

P.S. кстати, то ли из самой игры, то ли из мануала можно узнать потрясный рецепт бананового хлеба. Я лично его готовил, он реально хорош. Если хотите чего-то эдакого - рекомендую обратить внимание на рецепт.",1,1,0,0,1,2020-09-20,2020-09-20,217,21,933,449
"Its a very old game that is unplayable on WIN10 without a lot of fiddling with the program files. It is very easy to corrupt the save file by alt-tabbing and playing just a few minutes will cause the game to start experiencing significant slowdown. 

The character customization is a little dated, with multiple races being exclusive to male characters with  no exclusive races for female characters.

The game doesn't seem to have an in-game listing for keyboard shortcuts, nor does the UI show you what shortcut goes to what.

"I bought this game during a Steam sale because people online said that it was the spiritual successor to Fallout 1. It is not.

The combat system is crap. It starts off real time and there is no time to make decisions since you have to go into menus to choose which attacks/spells you want to do. You can change it in the options to turn-based, but that combat is even worse because the game wasn't balanced on it. 

There are too many needless items. I only played the game until the first town because the combat was so bad, but I had an entire inventory and follower inventory completely full with items that I couldn't even barter with. I'm assuming that some of them are for crafting, but I couldn't store them until I got to a point when crafting would be viable, otherwise I couldn't pick up any other items. 

The user interface is clunky and un-intuitive. 

The game runs through a launcher that isn't compatible with Steam. I played for like and hour and a half, then exited the game, but steam still thought the game was running. When I pressed STOP in Steam, the phantom game kept going. I used task manager to close the game. Steam still said it was running. I had to re-launch the launcher then exit the game so that could finally press STOP to be able to uninstall the game on Steam. My hours are like 11 on Steam because I didn't realize it was still ""running"" in the background.

Easy method, enter steams install directory for Arcanum and create a shortcut to the main executable file and add to the target field in properties after the file paths end quote -no3d. -no3d is built into the game.

Another option is to use the Unofficial Arcanum Patch 2.02 latest version downloaded online, it has DDraw compat included and will modify the DDraw.dll file allowing the game to run on windows 8 and up. The version is correct and works well, better than DXwrapper.

"The Good
========
The setting for this game has been developed with a lot of depth. One can slowly discover it while going along the main quest. Side quests also often provide extra bits of information that flesh out the world even more.
If you like exploring and discovering a complex world as you go along, you will like this game.
The whole idea of Magick-vs-Technology goes much deeper than what is known to the player upon character creation, as are the specificities of the various ""races"".
The setting seems to draw some inspiration from the real-life Victorian Era, some from Tolkien (which is actually consistent, as a glimpse of the beginning industrial revolution is described at the end of the last book from the Lord of the Rings).
Many assumptions that your character (and you) may have at the beginning of the game will change as you go along, which is a good thing.

Also, this game runs fine on Linux (at least with the standard patch recommended elsewhere, which should be installed anyway).

The Bad
=======
After the first few hours of playing, going from location to location becomes a bit of a hassle. The wilderness map (with random encounters) is quite alright, but the annoying bit is travelling around a town and exiting the town in order to access the wilderness map.
A partial workaround is to use the teleportation spell. This can be learned if one chooses to specialize in Magick, or can be used by an NPC follower... well, not quite: a ""cheat mod"" is needed, called ""Virgil Debug menu"", but it can be used in a non-cheat way like this: take control of NPCs leveling schemes (switch to ""No Scheme""), keep Virgil as a follower and have him progress until he can learn Teleport. Then use the menu provided by the mod, but think of it as actually asking Virgil to use his teleport spell, which is quite reasonable, really.
By the way, there are quite a few spells, like teleport, that a follower can learn but won't use and can't be asked to use, which is a bit sad (conversely, technological followers can be asked to use their schematics).

The Ugly
=======
Sometimes immersion is broken by dialog that seems to have been designed to satisfy  a 15-year old boy's sexual fantasies, e.g. suggesting to a maid that she can go and work in a brothel instead, which she will happily do (and seem happy to have done afterwards - seriously?), or asking a widow whether you can ""comfort her"" (literally written like that, with a cut scene if you do). Also, apparently this kind of awkward dialog stays the same if your PC is female.",1,1,0,2,1,2020-08-01,2020-08-01,0,5,31987,31987
I played it when I was younger so it was a real nostalgia trip for me. I enjoyed coming back to it and seeing there be a community for it. If you enjoy older types of games with a good open world and story I'd reccomend it.,1,1,0,1,0,2020-07-29,2020-07-29,118,3,2012,286
"9/10 - What an excellent game... took three tries to get past the slow opening; Extremely glad and satisfied to experience it.

+++ For fans of Vampire TM, Fallout 1 & 2, DoS, Planescape... even Disco Elysium - this game is a treat
+++ Do soup your experience up with the latest patch, level cap remover and Arcanum Edit to correct leveling mistakes/experiment
+++ Fantastic lore, world, design, characters, narration, story, exposition and art
++ Writing is top notch as each character in the game is well realized and the world quite believable
++ Some flying ""aces"" with orc-like features down your airship and a survivor starts your journey with his dying breath...
++ Be a mage patrician or a crafting pleb or min/max to do both adequately with level cap mod remover
++ Very original game that has few contemporaries being quite unique
++ Plays like F1/2 with a higher learning curve to fully understand the game mechanics
++ When looting there are 2 TABS, be sure to check both INVENTORY and BODY as I missed the BODY part for my first 10 hours...
++ Do use a guide/look up items to smooth out/modernize the game as tutorials are formalized in the game manual which should be read
++ You cannot steal equipped items without using fate points/stone body exploit - thankfully DoS did not follow this principle
++ Stable/no crashes/latest unofficial patch a dream; performance wonderful with only light stuttering as you hoard away a king's ransom
+ Majority of items in the game are useless/limited purpose. Do look up their purpose prior to starting your collection spread over random drawers/barrels all over the world's cities
+ Garbage cans are not a permanent storage of your gems & trinkets
+ Humor usage wonderful; plenty of homages and wonderful moments
+ Ending slides quite memorable


- Main story falls off a bit/quite similar to PoE philosophical overtures making it difficult to follow especially in the last act
- If only this was not rushed/released full of bugs/incomplete at launch. Shame so much potential did not have a chance of producing further excellent craftsmanship due to the shortcomings on the business side.",1,1,0,2,0,2020-07-28,2020-07-28,0,347,3567,3567
"It may be just nostalgia but I love Arcanum a lot more then modern CRPG. The setting is late 18th century to mid 19th century our time but with some traces/ history of magic. The world is incredibly immersive, everything from how people talk to how they dress to the  music, even character portraits   feel at home during that time period. 
Where the game lacks is  companions, while there are enough companions and are interesting in concept only a few of them have a voice and even fewer have a good enough story and interactions to make you care for them.",1,1,0,1,0,2020-07-26,2020-08-10,343,49,1381,660
For some reason I did not play Arcanum at all in 2001 when it was originally released. Perhaps because it had a reputation for being buggy and released too hasty while still being unfinished.  Now I bought this for Steam summer sale out of curiosity and decided to give it a try. Installed unofficial patch also which is pretty much required for Win 10 systems. So far I have tried charismatic elven mage and ugly dwarven thief technologist. Very interesting and different experience! Now I can clearly see that this game was well ahead of its time. Finally a game where charisma (and beauty) has some real gameplay effect. Same goes with intelligence. In addition the magical and technological amplitude dilemma is cool once you get the understand the basics. At least with unofficial patch this game is still very playable almost after 20 years of its original release! You cannot say the same for many games!,1,1,0,0,0,2020-07-26,2020-07-26,0,2,3553,2805

[h1] Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura Review | Arcade Theory [/h1]

The title’s quite a mouthful, isn’t it? Let’s just call it Arcanum from now on. This is an old game for sure. So old, in fact, that on a modern setup, it won’t work straight out of the box. Be sure to install this patch to ensure your game doesn’t crash and burn on launch. Yet the fact that people even bother to go through such hoops to run this game is an indication of how good this game is. Indeed, Troika Games may be defunct now, but there is but one game the studio will forever be known for: Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines.

The setting that the game takes place in is unique not because of the overall worldbuilding but because of the industrial revolution the land of Arcanum is experiencing. Magick has always been the predominant force in the land’s history, the elves being the most magically-attuned race, churning out generations of the greatest mages. Technology has also existed in some form or another, with the dwarves being expert technologists, but has never been as powerful or as venerated as magick.

In comes a man called Gilbert Bates (a completely fictional character, I assure you), who kicks off the industrial age with the introduction of the steam engine to the human world. Unfortunately, magick and technology are not compatible with each other, as technology follows the rules of natural law while magick is a supernatural force with no constraints from the natural order. When the two forces meet, instability results.

This brings us to the issue of coexistence between magicians and technologists. Since the invention of the steam engine, many cities in the kingdoms around Arcanum have become industrialized and thus utilize technology to its fullest extent. Spellcasters will find themselves unable to make use of their repertoire while within the cities (lore-wise, at least). In fact, should they get too close to a piece of machinery, they risk causing it to malfunction due to the abnormal nature of magick. It is less of an issue with weak magicians, but nevertheless, they must choose to either segregate themselves within the cities (e.g. ride the back of the train, avoiding the engine room) or distance themselves from cities altogether. Such is the course the elven races chose for themselves, living in their forested communities away from humanity.

Translated into game mechanics, the antagonistic duality of magick and technology is clear. Your affinity toward either magick or technology depends on your aptitude, a score based on how many points you put either to magical spells or technological disciplines. If your technical aptitude is high, you gain bonuses toward using technology but will find the use of magic to be less potent or even nullified. Similar effects occur the other way around, with extremely high aptitudes having effects on the game world itself (you simply cannot ride a train if your magical aptitude is too high). This means you have to choose between one or the other. No gunslinging wizards.

Should you choose technology, you get access to guns. What else could you really want in a fantasy world? Here, you have access to eight different technological disciplines:

    [*]Chemistry
    [*]Electric
    [*]Explosives
    [*]Gun Smithy
   [*] Herbology
    [*]Mechanical
    [*]Smithy
    [*]Therapeutics

Each time you spend a point on a discipline, you increase your level of understanding known as your expertise. Higher expertise lets you utilize more complex schematics for that discipline. Schematics are like blueprints. Get the crafting materials you need, be it batteries or a tonic, and you can craft items from grenades to poisons to robotic spiders. It’s a lot more work than magick, but magick doesn’t let you blast someone in half with an elephant gun.

Then you have magick, with 16 spell colleges and five spells each, for a whopping total of 60 spells total. High willpower is required to learn more spells within a single college. Here is a list of the spell colleges available:

    [*]Conveyance
   [*] Divination
   [*] Air
   [*] Earth
   [*] Fire
   [*] Water
    [*]Force
   [*] Mental
    [*]Meta
    [*]Morph
    [*]Natural
    [*]Black Necromantic
   [*] White Necromantic
    [*]Phantasm

There’s plenty of spells to learn. Resurrection lets you fully revive any fallen comrade, teleportation lets you fast travel to any location you’ve visited, and polymorph lets you turn anyone you want into a harmless animal like a bunny or a sheep. Once you learn a spell, you have no limit on how many times you can cast it, save for fatigue. Hopefully you’ve been increasing your fatigue points if you’re a mage because once it goes below 0, your character passes out on the ground and won’t wake up until it is back in the positives. So, if a spell costs 60 fatigue points and you only have 1 fatigue point on hand, you’ll be doing a lot of waiting.

When we begin the game, we are greeted by a lovely cutscene of a zeppelin in flight, moments before it is shot down by a pair of half-ogres in fighter planes. Turns out, you were on that flight. You miraculously survive as the sole survivor, but not without being greeted by the best character in the game: Virgil.

Virgil is a member of the Panarii religion, based on the teachings of Nasrudin, who you are supposedly a reincarnation of. “And the spirit of Nasrudin shall be reborn on wings of fire in hills shrouded in fog, and fight the last battle with the evil one,” so sayeth the Panarii altar near the crash site. Seeing that you did just crawl out of a burning wreckage and that the nearest town over is named Shrouded Hills, you don’t really have cause to doubt the prophecy. So, you set out with Virgil (unless you killed him) on a quest to discover the owner of an engraved ring which you took from a dying gnome from the crash site.

The story takes you places all over Arcanum, meeting important individuals that are essential to the plot. So essential, in fact, that you can straight up murder them. You have plenty of choices you can make in this game, both in dialogue and in quest progression. This applies to the main story as well. To prevent players from softlocking themselves for being a murderous psychopath, there will always be a method to continue the story despite an essential NPC being dead, such as a journal or note that happened to be on their corpse. Anyone can be killed off, even Virgil, although you should spare him. His alignment is dependent on your own actions. If you are a good character, he too shall become a good character. If you choose to be a heartless scoundrel, he shall follow in your footsteps.

There are many other companions you can recruit—some of them having a great deal of dialogue and significance to the story—but none of them had the same impact as Virgil. Without spoilers, his subplot and related character development will make you glad you didn’t cut him loose at the start. [...]",1,1,0,1,0,2020-07-14,2020-07-14,2647,20,1913,1913
"This is clearly a good game, especially for anyone who enjoyed playing the original fallout series. I am giving the game a positive review, but Arcanum has serious issues playing on windows 10, at least for my computer. A lot of die hard fans are saying 'download this patch' and 'follow these instructions to reduce lag' etc. I spent several hours trying to figure this out, and nothing worked. The game just doesn't run very well on my computer. And I don't think it's just me. Imagine having to wait 4+ minutes to watch your avatar run out of the city so that you can fast travel. It would take less time to read or write this review. The good folks at Steam should put some effort into adapting this game to the modern operating systems, so that we can all enjoy this classic game the way it was meant to be played.",1,1,0,3,0,2020-07-12,2020-07-12,0,1,1500,1463

"I played this when it first came out, and I'm hoping to have time to replay this game again someday.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Story is great. One of my favourites over the last ~25 years of playing RPGs. Also the writers were not afraid to cover some darker subject matter
[*]Fate point system is pretty cool. You can at rare times force a success on some things using saved up points
[*]Character stat differences lead to meaningful impact in how you play the game or navigate the storyline, for example: all your dialogue lines change if you have low intelligence
[*]Interesting setting. Magic and technology used together
[*]Crafting is useful
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Graphics a little dated now, and by default the game only runs in 800x600 resolution.
You can get some sort of patch to increase that, but it doesn't seem to work for 4k resolutions (the mouse is not interacting with the UI)
[*]No glorious 2020 remaster with endless replayability of the game out there :'(

"This game has many, many facets. It's huge, open-ended, lots of options and gameplay styles, but it does not hold your hand. No tutorial or anything.

Make in 2001, it has that 1990s cRPG (computer RolePlaying Game) feel to it, and I love that kind of thing.

I haven't played it much yet, but I can tell I'll need to do a lot of research and maybe download some patches before I can really get into it. That said, I'm glad I bought it, nevertheless.",1,1,0,0,0,2020-07-06,2020-10-04,0,119,1030,150

"Arcanum is one of my favourite games, it has a vast world with about 70 side quest scattered throughout the world.
The game features a large amount of recruitable party members which you can find in towns and dungeons, all brimming with personality. 

Arcanum excels at is expanding your vocabulary, it's filled with English commonly used throughout the industrial revolution period in England and mixing it with vocabulary you would find in fantasy type games. Arcanum allows you to solve various problems your way using upgrade skills, items or abusing the way the combat system works to it's fullest, speaking of which, it's not very balanced; you can change between real time and turn based combat based on which is more favourable to you. 

The plot is grand, it's interesting to follow but it isn't any LISA game, but the lore is pretty damn big and also enjoyable, for this alone I recommend that you read the manual but I also recommend it because it's necessary if you don't want to spend hours trying to figure out how everything works, also it has a banana bread recipe at the end, unfortunately I do not like bananas but maybe you do.

The graphics aren't all that impressive, however they feel nostalgic since I've had this game since my 12th birthday, but the soundtrack is pretty good 

Unfortunately time passes and as a result this game is old, you're going to need to install the unofficial patch for this game to fix the slowdown issue among several others. Also the game doesn't have support for online multiplayer, you can only really do that through LAN or some alternative method of fixing multiplayer (if you really want to jump through hoops).

It isn't too difficult however progression somewhat relies on utilizing the many quests available to level up as a preferable alternative to grinding, it encourages exploration but you don't have to 100% the game.

10/10

"Old-school charm and an intriguing premise ultimately don't save the pervasive issues of this competent, but mismanaged, CRPG classic. From obscure interactions and obtuse mechanics to terrible real-time combat, 'enjoying not having your hand held' is more 'being dumped on Everest and told to find civilisation equipped only with a spoon and a xanex prescription'.

Companion and NPC dialogue is limited. For the most part, you cannot advance your relationship with your followers at all except for story-related events. Conversations rely on basic dialogue trees and boil down to 'I'll help you' and ""i'll kill you'. Towns have obnoxious layouts that discourage backtracking and exploration. Dungeons and world map areas have wildly varying difficulties that make save-scumming a necessity just to survive.",0,1,0,3,0,2020-06-28,2020-06-28,0,17,1564,1270
"!!BEFORE YOU START THE GAME:
1. To play on windows 10 without issues install this mod: https://terra-arcanum.com/drog/uap.html. It fixes the bugs, enhances gameplay including high resolution. 
2. DISABLE G-sync and steam overlay. Delete your old save files. 
3. Read the patch's readme PLEASE. It explains everything. 

This is how I got the game to work flawlessy through steam on windows 10 ver.1909.

Otherwise HILARIOUS game, I love how absurd it is, it's a true rpg by essence. If you're ugly, all the NPCs notice and some refuse to talk to you, if you're stupid all the NPCs react to that. If you got some fugly zombie summons behind you, NPCs get scared and refuse to talk to you. Your choices do matter, your good/evil alignment matters. If you love technology or magic that MEGA matters. 

One huge gripe I have about this game though is the maps in the main city hubs don't mark what the buildings are and I find myself running around the darn map looking for the same NPCs over and over. (and 1 main city is HUGE).

*WARNING*: If you're looking for a FULL STORY playthrough DO NOT make an EVIL alignment character. There is a COMPANION called MAGNUS that is CRUCIAL to the story and he won't join your party IF YOU ARE EVIL ALIGNMENT!

Character creation is interesting and somewhat flexible. The writing is fantastic and the concepts are admirable for an RPG. Race relations, Steampunk elements, all play a role in the game world. You can read newspapers, and when you walk around a city you actually get that industrialized feeling thanks to the excellent background art. 

Of course, the character interactions are fantastic as well. I won't give any examples to refrain from spoilers, but this is definitely a game that requires you to THINK and TAKE NOTES. It's one of the grand-daddies of modern RPGs.",1,1,0,6,1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,570,91,489,267

Its essentially original Fallout including the ability to play as a low int brute who responds like a complete simpleton and who will be treated like one in kind. If you know what I'm talking about then you will probably like this game. Also if you plan on playing a spellcaster you will absolutely need to take Harm and Charm Animal at first, but from there you can just go along whatever path you feel like. 

There's a number of small nuances that are unique to this games mechanics and UI but theres plenty of answers to everything on google with how old this game is now.

"Fallout is an absolute masterpiece, but if I have to point a flaw I'll say it's a bit too short. I always finish it wanting more, but Fallout 2, while good, is a bit bloated and unfocused. Of course, there's an alternative. Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura could actually be considered the true successor to Fallout, as its developers left in the middle of Fallout 2's development to make this game.

There's something that immediately engages you in Arcanum's character creation. I think it's the portraits: selecting fantasy races while seeing the portraits change between half-orcs in a gentleman's attire to elven women in makeup, it tells you right away that this is a far cry from your average fantasy RPG. Of course, if you didn't know, Arcanum is set in a fantasy world that's undergoing an industrial revolution. The worldbuilding is great, as you see orcs being treated as slave labour in factories and elves slowly losing their forests as machines cut them down. We are often too short-lived to see the consequences of our actions, and this is shown in a more interesting light when there are long-lived fantasy races to berate our hastiness. Luddite kingdoms become shadows of their former selves, and mages slowly lose the power that separated them from the common man, while vehemently keeping to their belief that technology is merely a fad and will go away ""soon"". 

You see, magick and technology cannot coexist: the manual explains this with detailed in-universe experiments, but the gist of it is that technology relies on the laws of nature while magick distorts them. This conflict is reflected in your character. You can learn spells and technological schematics, and as you do so you'll gain more magickal or technological affinity. Become too attuned to magick and you'll be barred from first class trains in fear that you'll make the engine malfunction; become too attuned to technology and both harmful and healing spells will fizzle out on you. This isn't all the ways people will react to you: playing as a dwarf, most people just told me to go away and that they didn't want anything to do with me, making me have to convince them to talk. The way people will react and respond to you differs heavily on race, affinity and reputation, and Arcanum is easily a high-water mark for reactivity in RPGs.

There's an insane amount of variety in what your character can do. Focusing on magick lets you learn dozens of spells, from basic damage to speaking with the dead to teleporting around instead of taking the train. Focusing on technology lets you craft all manner of things, from steampunk firearms to flame swords to mechanized spiders that will follow you around and fight with you, and much, much more. That's not all: much like in Fallout, you can invest in other skills and focus on gambling, melee, firing bows or persuading people. These skills are improved by putting points into them as usual for RPGs, but you can also gain special bonuses in them from talking to people and requesting training. For each skill, there's even a special quest that enables you to become a Master of it. While in my several playthroughs of Fallout I've often relied on Speech and Guns (barring a hilarious foray into a low Intelligence character), Arcanum lets you make much more varied characters.

Most of the game will be spent exploring towns and doing quests. These offer a large variety of ways to solve them as well: You can often kill quest characters to find some way to advance the quest in their bodies, you can use magick to talk to them after they're dead, pick the lock on their chests while they sleep (or just break it with your rifle because they're very heavy sleepers), just talk them into saying the right things, and I'm probably missing some things here. The towns are a bit too large sometimes (I've often set waypoints to walk to the town's exit, as you cannot open the world map and travel somewhere else unless you're outside of town, and just went to do something else while my characters walk), and the visuals are a bit bland, but the music makes up for it. These moody and melancholic strings are just beautiful, and they have stayed in my head for the past few days when I'm doing something else. Special mention goes to the opening cutscene music: it's really great seeing this aerial battle scored to just a string quartet. Sadly, I think the overworld feels a bit empty: like Fallout, overland travel is done through a map, but it takes way too long. I've spent five in-game years travelling back and forth, which makes the world feel way too empty, with towns months away from each other, which is not that realistic. The map would be better if it was a smaller and more condensed space.

Extremely intricate reactivity, quests with countless ways to solve them and endless build variety, a great setting... what makes Arcanum not stand with Fallout as an all-time RPG classic in the eyes of everyone? Well, sadly Arcanum isn't a very... finished game. The combat can be real-time or turn-based depending on your preference, and neither is fun. When the game wants you to fight something, it's going to be a dungeon that takes forever to go through, often with enemies that will break your armor and weapons, leading to fun tactical questions such as: ""why is my entire party naked and unarmed?"" Some of these dungeons can be skipped with certain skills (persuasion or invisibility, for example), but not all of them. 

In Fallout, the only ""dungeon"" I can think of that forces you into combat (and I suppose Fallout's combat isn't exactly great, but it's very elevated by great animations and enjoyable feedback text... and no armor breaking), and that's Vault 15, which is technically optional. The game feels very unbalanced: I usually play real-time to get the bad combat over with, but I will always switch to turn-based when the enemy's an archer, as they might as well be carrying an Uzi with their insane firing rate. One first-level spell will also turn the combat into a clicker minigame, as you are only limited by how fast you can click on something when you cast magic in real-time. Apart from the combat, the game feels very unfinished at points. While I may sometimes wish that Fallout would be longer, Arcanum is an example of ""be careful what you wish for"", as its latter half piles on bland dungeons and endless trash fights. And good luck if you haven't saved in a while and accidentally press quicksave (F7) instead of quickload (F8) because a companion died, since the game doesn't care and will save in the middle of combat.

Arcanum is a prototype for the greatest RPG of all time. The game itself is quite good, but the sheer potential that it still has can make you sad thinking of what could have been. Nevertheless, it's very much worth playing: stomach the bad combat and rushed areas, and you'll be able to experience something that often comes close to being the pinnacle of role-playing games.

"I have learned the hard way recently that all of these old, classic games being offered on Steam will not play on today's computer systems.  Like me, you will bang your head against the wall trying to figure out how Compatibility Mode might be able to save your potentially non-refundable purchase.  You will search for hours online trying to learn all the stupid ways that people have tried using so that they can play these old games.

After your great investment of time, you will then discover like I did that there is no resolution - you wasted your money.  So far, there have been a few games where I was trying to get them to work, which included loading the games.  This puts them on the Steam timer.  Did you know that you only have 2 hours before you can request a refund?  What if your refund date has passed?  Did you know that you have about 2 weeks to request the refund?

Don't put yourself through this experience.  I understand the nostalgia - that's why I spent the $3.24 or the $4.99 in the first place.  But do yourself a favor, instead.  Go to your wallet and pull out a $5 bill.  Next, take a lighter and burn that $5 bill into a crisp.  (Be safe with this - don't burn anything else.)  After you finish this exercise, you will have realized that you just did the equivalent of buying Arcanum, a classic PC game, on Steam.  And if you ever want to buy any other old games on Steam, then get out your wallet and repeat.  Eventually, you will stop wanting old nostalgic games because THEY DO NOT WORK ON TODAY'S SYSTEMS and you sure as heck aren't going to want to bang your head against a wall trying to make them work and potentially losing out on your refund opportunity.",0,1,0,9,5,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,0,53,26,16

"I'd never played a serious RPG game before Arcanum and now, after looking into others, it might not have been the best to start the journey with as there's no in-game prompts to learn. However I still really enjoyed it from the very beginning - it reminded me of growing up playing Dungeons & Dragons with how engrossed I became!

There are a number of choices for characters and I wasn't aware how significant these choices would be on the game as it progressed. You can reach your maximum level (50) quite quickly and can then become a bit stuck if you've kept your skills too general (ie without enough specialisation). I also didn't realise how crucial a team was to the success of this game and so my character became very strong but had not picked up enough team mates early which became problematic later in the game. So it's probably worth doing a bit of research before you start instead of diving straight in like I did!

I did have a lot of trouble playing this game on Windows 10, and so I learnt to save very regularly! I tried the unofficial patch which seems to help a lot of people (as well as resolving the level 50 cap) but it never worked for me. The main issue was extreme lagging when any sort of 3D graphic was introduced, this got to the point where the game was almost unplayable. Once I worked out what was causing it, I tended to save the game just prior to the 3D part, slog through the section with it and save, then restart the game which would get rid of the lag. Not an ideal experience but I was committed at that point! 

I will always remember this game as the one that kick-started my RPG gaming experience, and from that side of things, I think it set the bar high!",1,0,0,3,0,2020-06-10,2020-06-10,118,5,9983,9839

"[h1]Magie und Technik[/h1]
Arcanum war in den frühen 2000er ein einzigartiges Spiel, das dem Spieler viele Entscheidungen selbst überlassen hat, z.B. welchen Weg er einschlägt, wenn es um die Frage nach Technik oder Magie geht. Ich habe damals unzählige Stunden in dem Rollenspiel verbracht; das Spiel ist extrem textlastig. Ich habe sicher alle Möglichkeiten ausprobiert, gut und böse, Elf oder Mensch; egal was.

"This game is a great, often overlooked, RGP classic.  Any fans of Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Vampire:  The Masquerade, would love this.

"In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#450 out of 612)... it's time for Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magicka Obscura.

Arcanum is one of the finest CRPGs ever made, and arguably the most impressive product legendary (if somewhat infamous) developer Troika Games ever built. It's a massive,, brilliantly open game in the vein of Fallout that offers players an unprecedented degree of freeom with regard to how they build their characters, how they play the game, and how they progress through the world. It's difficult to overstate just how deeply engaging Arcanum can be—this one is a classic roleplaying game for very good reason.

Part of what makes Arcanum so incredibly engaging is the setting: the world of Arcanum is that of a high fantasy setting experiencing an industrial revolution. A chaotic world plagued by all manner of social, political and economic problems that feels much like our own: ready to come apart by the seams at any moment but, somehow, impossibly, it keeps puttering on. An especially interesting idea is the interplay between magic and technology, which defines both the lore and mechanics of the game. In brief, proximity to technology wreaks havoc on magic, resulting in a clear delineation between the ""old world"" and ""new world"" – tradition and revolution. The often-dangerous, sometimes-catastrophic interplay between these two totally antithetical mechanisms also affects gameplay: technological weaponry may be incredibly effective, but it does not play well with the more conventional boons granted by magic—and NPCs will react to the player based on which end of the spectrum they embrace.

Which brings us to reactivity. And, good lord, is Arcanum a reactive game. Nearly every choice you make has a consequence as, like in the classic Fallout games, you make your way through the (fairly open-ended) main quest while balancing various relationships with the powerful factions that rule the land. Arcanum's is a complicated world that will constantly test you—physically, mentally and emotionally. As fantastical as the steampunk fantasy aesthetic is, the world itself feels very familiar: it's hard, impossible even, to ever know if you're making the right choice. Deciding who to trust and when is, therefore, as much a part of Arcanum as reality.

Granted, Arcanum has its share of flaws. Especially so at the time of release, when developer Troika games was forced to push the game out the door far before it was ready. Thankfully multiple patches, official and fan-made, have more or less solidified Arcanum into a coherent and stable experience. That said, many of the fundamental mechanics remain spotty. The world of Arcanum is large, and the maps you have access to can be a bit confusing at times, making navigation difficult. Many quests also suffer from unclear language, making it sometimes very difficult to discern where you're meant to go next to progress. This can be a double-edged sword as it encourages simply wandering about, and there's a great deal of interesting and compelling content to discover out in the wilds, but it can also feel frustrating and aimless. Perhaps most notably, Arcanum's combat system feels a little half-baked. Its is certainly one of the more ambitious combat systems compared to other CRPGs of the time, trying to offer both a turn-based mode in the style of Fallout as well as a real-time-with-pause mode in the style of Baldur's Gate, but the end result is that neither mode feels sufficiently engaging in its own right.

But even despite these issues, Arcanum shines brilliantly. The holy canon of classic CRPGs does not list many titles, and there's good reason Arcanum often stands near the top.

"In short, Arcanum has writing in the style of Baldur's Gate 1 (but better-executed) and overall feel in the style of Fallout 2. 

I really enjoyed the plot, although it takes 3/4 of the game before it really gets rolling. The interface is rough around the edges, but that was par for the course at the time of its creation. The world is huge but largely empty, and the characters are mostly empty shells. The game desperately needed more music. The mechanics allowed a wide variety of character builds and allowed a few ways of completing many quests. Combat starts challenging, but becomes too easy by mid-game and never poses a serious challenge again. Unfortunately, the dungeons compensate by being much too long, often requiring an hour or more of boring slog.

For all that, I enjoyed Arcanum. It has a novel system and a fun mystery for you to uncover. During the last quarter of the game, I was constantly excited to see what was coming next. If you're wondering whether to play this or Baldur's Gate, go with BG every time. But there's no rule that says you can't try both, so Arcanum is worth a shot too.",1,1,0,1,0,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,0,62,2423,2423

Probably one of the best steam punk games I have ever played so much so that I purchase the digital copy years later.  This game was well thought out with very in depth story line.  Also the world if beautiful and there is so many hours of game play you can chose to do other than the story line.   I also love the dynamic where if you use magic than you are bad with technology and if you use technology than you react badly with things that are magic.

"While I have owned this game as a hard copy for many years before purchasing it on steam, I will try to keep out my bias towards the game.

The game universe is exceedingly well fleshed out for an RPG of this type, and lends itself to world building quite well, Its character creation is fleshed out just enough to let you run any type of character you could possibly imagine, and then some (viability of such builds not withstanding) The voice acting is brilliantly done and gives you a feel for each unique character to be themselves, not cardboard cut outs of your generic bad guy or good guy.

Though thats not to say the game is perfect, because using Guns in this game is a tedious and almost pointless process, thanks to being out scaled by STR/DEX melee builds (You can run around as a human that can kick wolfs heads off by level 15ish) or Dark necromancy Harm mage builds that you run in real time combat mode and just delete anything that looks at you funny by spam clicking with the spell until your foe crumples, As well as the fact that on windows 10, you have to download a couple of Dlls to get the game to actually run at a stable framerate, as well as get a couple of patches to bring the game closer to a modern era.

You can be a smooth, suave halfling that gets absolutely hammered before you fuck a sheep in a brothel while saving the world, Or you can be a bitter and cold half orc warrior that opts to end the world due to the racism you suffer through out your experience. The limit to what you can do comes down to your skill as a player and the grit you have to suffer through grinding out the low levels before your build becomes anywhere near viable.

All in all, Not a bad game, Definitely worth a buy, Just remember though, Troika isnt making any money off this, only steam. Yarhar.",1,1,0,0,0,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,378,11,1742,823

"Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura... oh, this game...

In spite of my low ownership, I am more than familiar with this bizarre, wonderful masterpiece, a game I sometimes thought was a complete fever dream from the depths of my imagination, among a strange number of other games including an action game involving Skittles and a dark knight. I'm still not sure that one still exists, though.

Arcanum is NOT a fever dream, however, and does in fact exist and is a masterpiece of a forgotten era where computers had the ability to deal with the unique and antiquated graphical features on their own. Because Microsoft doesn't know how to keep good features from previous operating systems, it is imperative that you look up a tutorial on how to play this game, and while on your way, pick up an unofficial patch and maybe a few mods; one of which being Virgil's Debug Menu. You won't regret it.

Arcanum is a very unique CRPG, created on the same engine as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planetscape: Torment and Fallout: the Infinity Engine, but shares very little else with those other four games. Its mechanics are unique, relying less on the classic alignments and statlines in favor for showcasing its unique flavor. Your stats are Strength (obvious), Constitution (which, while it helps HP, it is more focused on improving your resistances), Dexterity (your most important physical stat), Perception (your most important mental stat), Willpower (where you get more HP and Fatigue), Intelligence (your other most important mental stat), Beauty (which affects how people like you) and Charisma (which allows you to bring more followers). There are no classes, everything is based on proficiency which takes up the same skill points as your Stats, making each level up a vital decision on how you improve your character. Give up hope on creating an ultimate, unstoppable character with 20 in all stats and fully maximized skills unless you desire abusing Virgil's Debug Menu. The races are your usual fare of Humans, Elves, Half-Elves, Gnomes, Half-Ogres, Dwarves, Halflings, and Half-Orcs, familiar to anyone who's ever seen a Fantasy game before, but their portraits are lovingly crafted to resemble those of Victorian photographs.

However, the main star of the show is the dichotomy between the eponymous technology and magic, as the game is highly affected by how you use both of these aspects of the world. You see, this world is undergoing a Victorian Era-esque industrial revolution, and technology is changing the world for the better and the worst. To represent these changes, the balance between magic and artificial technology is shifted, and how your character deals with this balance depends on your build. You can create a hybrid that doesn't mind either casting or creating gadgets, but by specializing in one or the other, you lock yourself from certain allies and make magic either less effective against yourself, or make science-y solutions less effective. Classism exists between those of magic and those of technological bent, as you'll be put on the back of the train if you are a dirty mage, or be seen as a spooky not-magical witch to the more superstitious. You can't win with people.

Your skills are also incredibly vital, and Troika, whose pedigree with Fallout can be clearly seen with a nifty little nod and the careful crafting of this world and its mechanics, has made every stat matter, with the way your character is built affecting nearly everything about this game. You can insert yourself the way you think you are, play as a mentally deficient man/womanchild with special needs and discover that everything changes based on your inability to learn names or concepts properly, and even whether or not you play as a Good or Evil character.

It is, however, a hard game. Most classic CRPGs are, but Arcanum can bring things to a different level. Early on in the game, you will be forced to brave a dungeon with monsters 10-15 levels stronger than your character, and can shatter your weapons. Of course, there are ways around this that don't involve cheating or massive amounts of grinding, but I prefer not knowing of such heresies. Don't fret, however, because whether you are good or evil, a master orator, a special needs Half-Ogre created by decades of selective eugenics and inbreeding [spoiler]and I wish I was not kidding about that part[/spoiler], a gunslinger that makes Roland Deschain look like a pansy, or a wizard that can put Elminster to shame, the game is worth it all the way to its climactic finale.

Now, if you excuse me, I have to find out if that Skittles game exists.",1,1,0,65,3,2020-02-06,2020-02-06,156,16,41057,41057

"Есть много хороших олдскульных игр в жанре RPG – тут вам и Baldur’s Gate и Neverwinter Nights  и тот же Fallout. Но, лично для меня, Arcanum был и остается лучшим представителем жанра партийных RPG и в этом обзоре я попробую объяснить почему.

Прежде всего, Арканум – это потрясающий, самобытный игровой мир. Мир, в котором на наших глазах рушатся старые устои и на смену сказочным фэнтезийным королевствам с их мудрыми (и не очень) монархами и благородными рыцарями, прекрасными принцессами и коварными колдунами, приходит новая эпоха – эпоха пара и стали, в которой нет более места средневековой романтике. В этом новом мире огромные густонаселенные города утопают в клубах черного дыма, исторгаемого из труб многочисленных заводов и фабрик,  поезда мчат по рельсам с невиданной доселе скоростью, а в небесах парят величественные дирижабли. И самое интересное в игре то, что она дает нам посмотреть одновременно на оба этих мира. Тут вам и густонаселенный мегаполис, на полное изучение которого у вас уйдет не один день (это не преувеличение!) и утративший ныне былое величие город, в котором еще живы обычаи и традиции прошлых веков, и загадочное поселение эльфов, скрытое в чащах вечного леса (если вы думаете что его легко найти – вас ждет большой сюрприз), и протяженные тоннели гномов, в которых немудрено заплутать, и академия  волшебников, спрятанная от посторонних глаз посреди огромной пустыни. Это далеко не полный перечень локаций, которые вы можете найти в ходе прохождения. Причем найти за одно прохождение игры все скрытые на карте локации задача практически нереальная. 

Второй интересной особенностью игры является геймплей, основанный на противопоставлении магии и технологии. Если вы думаете, что у вас получится облачиться в топовую механизированную броню и шмалять во всех файерболами – то нет, так не выйдет. Из за того, что магия и технология имеют принципиально разную природу, они крайне не дружат друг с другом. Да, на начальных уровнях игры вы можете параллельно и стрелять из револьвера и кастовать простые заклинания.  Однако вкладывая очки развития, например, в технологические навыки вы вскоре обнаружите, что вам все труднее и труднее скастовать элементарное заклинание первого уровня. Вышесказанное справедливо не только для ГГ но и для всех сопартийцев – даже не пытайтесь лечить магией вашего компаньона-технолога, это бесполезное занятие. Из вышесказанного следует, что вам придется крайне аккуратно подбирать состав партии и тактику во время сражений.

Третий огромный плюс игры – вариативность прохождения. Да, в этом плане игра очень близка к BG или Fallout. Почти любой квест можно выполнить 2-3 и более способами. Убеждение, подкуп, магия очарования, внимательное изучение улик, кражи со взломом или силовое решение проблемы – как выполнять квест решать только вам. Важно заметить, что в зависимости от вашего мировоззрения и навыков некоторые сопартийцы в принципе не будут присоединяться к ГГ а квестодатели не будут выдавать квесты, если посчитают ГГ неподходящей кандидатурой для их выполнения. Также приготовьтесь к тому, что ваши сопартийцы с разным мировоззрением будут конфликтовать друг с другом вплоть до драки или вообще покинут отряд. Приятной фишкой является возможность выбора режима боев - реалтайм или пошаговый. Далеко не все современные изометрические RPG могут этим похвастать.

Четвертый плюс – свобода выбора. Забудьте о «бессмертных» NPC, мейнквесте вида ""ГГ должен спасти мир"" и прочих условностях. Хотите сеять смерь и разрушение – пожалуйста. И в этом вам поможет сразу несколько «плохих» сопартийцев, которые будут в восторге от подобных действий! Чтобы понять масштаб – небольшой сюжетный спойлер. В одной из концовок игры действия ГГ  приводят к  полному уничтожению игрового мира как такового.

Что касается технической  составляющей, то и здесь как мне кажется тоже все неплохо. Конечно в игре 2001 года вы не увидите высокополигональных моделей персонажей или захватывающих спецэффектов. Но, в конце концов, у нас тут не action. Зато в игре есть прекрасно, с вниманием к деталям, нарисованные экстерьеры и интерьеры, которые помогают вам глубже погрузится в этот удивительный мир стимпанка и магии. А какая в игре музыка! Звучащие в игре композиции прекрасно передают атмосферу и дух игры.

Теперь поговорим о вещах более приземленных, таких как запуск игры на современном железе.
Приятной фишкой является то, что спустя почти 20 лет после релиза у игры все еще есть стойкая армия приверженцев, выпускающих комьюнити патчи. К игре также есть утилита, позволяющая запустить её в HD разрешениях. Из русскоязычных сборок, пожалуй, можно выделить Arcanum Multiverse Edition, включающую в себя множество правок и восстановление вырезанного контента. Тем же, кто уже проходил игру я очень рекомендую мод Arcanum Total Rebalance – он делает игру глубже, интереснее и сложнее.

С учетом вышесказанного, я крайне рекомендую к прохождению игру всем ценителям качественных, глубоких RPG – вы получите огромное удовольствие. Прохождение игры займет у вас в зависимости от стиля и уровня сложности от 50 до 100+ часов и, я надеюсь, навсегда сделает вас фанатом этой прекрасной игры.

"Good game, I like the freedom, the rpg elements, and exploration aspect to everything, but I can't recommend it with the level of bugs in the game. I know the game is old and not meant for Windows 10 - I don't hold it to the original developers, but if steam is going to offer it for modern machines then it should be somewhat stable (to get my recommendation at least). Even with the patch, I am forced to quick save constantly as it crashes quite often. The main crash is if I scroll too much in the local map. Another whenever I have to attack inanimate objects (this crashes it every time, but sometimes I can tab out to another program in the background, that I can't see because the game doesn't hide when not active, and then tab back to restore). 

Other times it locks up because of other events on my computer (I left my email open in the background and got a IM request which completely locked up the game - the game visuals stayed on the screen and the Windows 10 task manager showed behind it so it was a b--- to close). I also have to unplug my second monitor for the game to work. If I just turn it off sometimes window 10 will still detect it and mess with display settings which, you guessed it, hard freezes the game. 

Combat has also locked the game up. If my allies are on the other side of a closed door (just by chance the door was closed I'm not sure why) they weren't able to calculate how to path to the enemy. Sometimes that just makes them sit there and do nothing like idiots (that ally AI is really bad, one of the few things in the game I think the original developers could have done better), but on 2 or 3 occasions it just sat in a loop that wouldn't end (again a b---- to close in windows 10).",0,1,0,5,2,2020-01-15,2020-01-15,0,3,1743,1743

"Открытый мир, с множеством локаций в которых можно встреть огромное количество персонажей со своими историями и различными квестами, способными более детально и глубже раскрыть этот мир. 
Раса персонажа и биография, характеристики, мировозрение, отношение вас к магии или технологии - всё это определяет то, как окружающий мир будет реагировать на вас. И если у NPC будет шанс вас оскорбить, унизить или упомянуть ваши поступки в отрицательном ключе, они это обязательно сделают. 
Вариативность прохождения огромна. Можно играть за вора и обворовывать жителей городов и деревень, можно быть благородным рыцарем с большим отрядом спутников, магом одиночкой, гномом с винтовкой. Вариантов может быть очень много. 
Можно упомянуть еще 16 школ магии - телепортация, некромантия, вызов демонов, воскрешения существ и т.д.  и множество технических схем, позволяющих создавать роботов, создавать доспехи с двигателями, мощное оружие и различные приспособления.
Даже спустя столько лет в игру можно играть, скачав пару файлов с исправлением багов и улучшением качества.

"Juegazo. Hace mas de 10 años lo probé por primera vez, y desde ese día lo he jugado y re jugado hasta el cansancio, agotando las combinaciones y posibilidades de roleo que te brinda. Una historia genial (ideal para fanáticos de LOTR), infinitas combinaciones de habilidades y rasgos que te permiten salir del clásico Guerrero-Mago-Ladrón, pero sin alejarse de los fundamentos básicos, y miles de misiones con diversas resoluciones, lo que hace que la rejugabilidad sea enorme.
 Como todo, tiene ciertos fallos que pueden alejar incluso hasta al jugador mas experimentado, como las toscas mecánicas de combate en tiempo real, algunos bugs, y la constante manía de los seguidores de hacer exactamente lo contrario a lo que la lógica indica (te estoy mirando, Virgil), lo cual prueba tu resistencia a la frustración a niveles insospechados, y te induce a reservar un área del cerebro exclusivamente dedicada a activar el auto-guardado cada 15 segundos.

Весь город благодарит тебя за спасение или ненавидит за слив и скотство, золотой идол Кри улыбается тебе из инвентаря, все рады видеть тебя вновь, а Рейвен берёт за руку, как никто никогда не брал раньше (но это не точно). Игра про жизнь: если ты урод и кретин, ты узнаешь об этом от каждого встреченного человека. 
Уникальный бэкграунд для персонажей, – расы, пол, система развития перса  – всё на любой, даже самый извращённо-изысканный вкус. Восхитительные возможности, а не то, с чем ты живёшь свою жизнь. 
Каждый нпс - пубертатная мечта любого  3адрота двухтысячных, поражающая слух великолепной озвучкой  и богоподобными умениями. 
Музыка в игре вообще отдельный вид искусства и вполне себе отлично существует вне игры и объединяет души и примиряет сердца лучше любого красноречия. Струнные квартеты настолько смогли в колорит стимпанка, что продирают до мурашечек и создают неповторимые ощущения; музыкальное сопровождение, звуки эффектов и шумы настолько бесподобные и атмосферные, что хочется с ними сделать татуировку на всё тело. 
Два режима боя для самых отпетых извращенцев. Хаотичное развитие ""ни рыба, ни мясо"" для них же.

Не смотря на то, что игра древняя, она может уделать нос и сейчас любому современному проекту! Про нее можно сказать: ""Как жаль, что таких игр сейчас не делают"", завернуться рулетиком в одеяло и молиться всем богам о продолжении, ремейке, ремастере.... Ну хоть что-нибудь... Игра действительно сделана с душой, превосходный мир, смелые фундаментальные законы и их реализация, большой простор для отыгрыша своего персонажа, ну и конечно же увлекательная история, не лишенная ""вот это поворотов"". Загадки, самостоятельное решение которых принесет уйму удовольствия и обязательно сделает вашего героя чутоку или же не на шутку мощным. Так что никаких поисковиков, гайдов, делаем все сами, ручками и извилинами своего мозга для пущего эффекта, выброса эндорфинов и всего такого. Отдельного внимания заслуживает концовка игры.

А благодаря тому, что концовка представлена набором картинок под сопровождение голоса, рассказывающего, что произошло далее, вариантов концовок очень и очень много, вы будете приятно удивлены.

Представьте себе - на дворе 2к19, а игра все еще обновляется с помощью их усилий. Именно благодаря им можно не бояться потери прогресса и невозможности пройти некоторые квесты, в т.ч. сюжетные, что у меня возникало при первом знакомстве с игрой.

На сегодня выглядит как инди, но не обманывайтесь — мало какая инди в состоянии унести с собой такой объём текста, потянуть настолько сложную логику мира (ну разве что [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084019881/recommended/951830/]The Last Sovereign[/url]) и огромный безшовный мир, который можно пересечь из конца в конец не выходя на глобальную карту.

[h1]Магия против Техники[/h1]
Определённо магия круче. Без вопросов. Тут нет никакого баланса. Некоторые из модов выправляют этот перекос, но всё равно телепортация определённо круче путешествий пешкодралом, а адепт огнестрела обречён каждое утро обегать помойки Таранта в поисках расходников для изготовления патронов. С другой стороны рытьё в мусорных корзинах несёт в себе определённую долю привлекательности первооткрывателя халявы.

Тут можно идти любым путём. Можно даже не развивать никаких боевых навыков. В одном из моих прохождений, где я отыгрывал говоруна, за мной ходила такая толпа соратников, что они запинали главгада раньше, чем я успел их остановить, а он даже мяукнуть не успел. Тут можно пройти никого не убивая (кроме парочки сюжетных мобов, а главгада можно уговорить добровольно уйти из жизни дабы другим жилось лучше), тут можно отыграть злобного повелителя нежити или честного мечника, или тихого снайпера.

"I can definitely recommend this game. It has a learning curve, but you will figure it out looking around online. There is a good bit of player autonomy. And yes, it is really about roleplaying. The Victorian era theme is not cheesy, it is actually very neat. The 2D look is moody and calming in some ways. 
Like other games from that time, there is not a lot of visual control of your character. Doesn't matter, half the game is in your head. You are visualizing in your mind these conversations half the time. It is very much an RPG, like I said. 
You can go to options and switch between real-time combat and turn-based. Each have varying results depending on who you fight. You can be overwhelmed easily in this game, but eventually you start rounding out skills and are able to hold out. Enemies are not scaled to you, so be weary of places you go and whether the story has brought you there or if you are just there randomly. No autosave also, so yeah, save often, and never in combat or when you wasted a dialogue option you need. There are punishing mechanics in combat, and dialogue, so be mindful, and stay in character.",1,1,0,10,0,2019-11-14,2019-11-14,16,2,7875,6466

"2/10
Have fond memories of playing this years ago, though I don't think I ever beat it.  Seeing it on Steam, I had to give it another go in the hopes of actually making it to the end this time.  The concept is amazing: take some of the people who made Fallout and essentially do the same game except set in a steampunk fantasy world. There's exploring, custom characters, strange partners, and a number of quests that can be completed in different ways.

But as soon as the game came up I remembered what stopped me from ever getting too deep into it: this game is PAINFULLY slow. Even on a computer that is amazingly powerful compared to top of the line machines of its day, the game is constantly slowing down, locking up, loading, and generally being non-user-friendly.  I would think this would have been corrected at this point, but it took ages just to walk from one end of the first town to the other.  The game design certainly doesn't help either. There's no fast travel, you have to wait for the characters to catch up to the scrolling map, you have to move in segments from the map, and going from place to place on the world map requires you walk to the very edge of town before you can leave even if there are no enemies anywhere. Going between destinations on the world map is a drag, too, since you have to watch the dot that represents your party slowly move across the land in a days-long trek.  

I have only put about 5 hours into this at this point, but it feels like at least double that. Black Isle Games came out with Enhance Editions of their catalog (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Palnescape Torment), so why not this one, too?  There's a lot of cool ideas in here that I just wish I could get to a little faster.",0,1,0,9,2,2019-10-19,2020-06-23,0,98,311,310

"Classic game that really shines from a story, world building, and exposition perspective. Really interesting crafting system and nice variety of character play styles and builds. Surprisingly the voice acting is also superb and really has its moments.

Now for the bad parts. It is extremely dated graphically. Poor combat with boring enemies and really dumb party AI. Lots of bugs. Not necessarily obvious where your character must go or how to solve certain quests. I think that you can use a reference or guide when you get lost in this game and not lose any enjoyment. I also recommend following a non-spoiler character guide like the one below. Believe me, the combat of this game is not the strong point and you really don't want to waste more time with it than you need to.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S5RAzYY1rg

That being said, this is actually a very good game. The world that they have put together is very nice and enjoyable to experience. However, realize that the strong points of the game are the dialogues, small elements of role play, lore, etc. If those things appeal to you give it a try.

I would recommend getting this game on sale. There is always the chance that a bug (there are a lot of them) will ruin your playthrough, and you don't want to be spending too much just to run in to a game breaking bug.",1,1,0,3,0,2019-10-09,2019-10-09,174,20,302,236

"Nostalgia for dayzzzzz.
I used to play this game all the time. In fact, I still have the CD version but I went ahead and bought the steam version too.
NOTE: Since this game is old, you will likely need to do a fix for windows 10 otherwise it'll be kinda laggy regardless of hardware. There's also some mods such as the High Res mod that I'd recommend... 

Even among all the modern day games, VERY few games immerse me into its world like this game does. Without giving away too many spoilers, this game really has an amazing variety of elements. You have a nation that believes in chivalry and the ways of knighthood, a nation that believes in industry and technology, elven cities, dwarf clans, magic, guns, and steampunk tech. This game is awesome for roleplaying. Whether you want to be a dwarf that recruits all the dwarf followers while in search of his own clan. Or you can be a powerful elf mage that attempts to recouncile and recruit from elf factions despite their differences. Options are limitless. Also, there's a ton of interesting things to find out and locations to explore in the world. 

I've played real-time combat mode ever since the game came out so I can't speak to turn-based. I like the fast paced combat more. Getting master in bow or gun and seeing the insane attack speed is awesome. Definitely recommend.",1,1,0,3,0,2019-09-27,2019-09-28,0,9,1170,753

"Its the game where you can play as a pistol wielding knight. Its by no means the best CRPG, and even contains quite a few bugs and flaws (as its studios shut prematurely, it lacks a great deal of polish) with the realtime combat system being one of the more standout flaws. But despite all the negative aspects to it, it still presents an amazing and surprisingly unique world, which originally pulled in my attention with its steampunk theme back in 2007. 

Arcanum provides a curious world that combines steam technology with high fantasy, where magick exists in a troubled state against the rising steam and electric machinery tech in 1885 that distort the nature of the world around it. Spellcasting elves and technological dwarves exist among humans and halflings in a decent sized, if somewhat empty map. Its not a bright land, its rather dreary, but its captivating, its a bit lonely, its wonderful, and its accompanied by woefully pleasant violin music. If that all sounds good to you, that's probably enough for you to enjoy this game.

Its esoteric, and you really need to know how the game works to enjoy it. Expect your first character to suck, and hard. Don't worry about playing on easy, as it makes the experience much nicer. Make sure to save often, because it is definitely buggy.

I could say many more positive and many, many more negative things, but all in all Arcanum is my favorite CRPG. I definitely recommend it for fans of the classic Fallout games and steampunk themes.",1,1,0,10,0,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,470,83,1110,850

"Господа, представляю Вам лучшую RPG-Стимпак-Фентези и за прошедшие 18 лет, врядли в найдёте похожий аналог.

  Начну с того, что это творение бессмертной Troika Games, они же выходцы из Black Isle, они же люди, которые ставят чудовищные планки качества, которые врезаются тебе в память и преодолеть которые другим проектам охренеть как трудно.

  RPG проекты я оцениваю по нескольким параметрам, но один из самых важных это диалоги... И знаете что? Эту игру можно пройти чисто диалогами, т.е. вообще без необходимости уничтожения противника, а сами диалоги могут быть интеллектуально наполнены милыми светскими беседами или лютейшим трешем бухого огра из подворотни, которые в последствии перерастут в поножовщину. Женские и мужские ветки диалогов различаются кардинально, а слабоумный персонаж это вообще треш и угар.
  И приготовьтесь, ведь когда счётчик магия/технология отклониться сильно в одну из сторон, Вас будут унижать. Вы великий эльф-маг? Дворфы-технологи скорее считают вас петушком. Вы гениальный дворф-технолог? Темные эльфы культурно объяснят возле какой параши ваше место. Вы полуорк, ну тогда весь Арканум будет считать Вас отбросом общества.  Вы женщина в патриархальном обществе, вы сами это выбрали...Вы решили взять полуогра, забудь про пистоли, ибо твои пальцы-сардельки тупо не пролезут в пистолетную скобу.

  Другой элемент - развитие героя... Тут можно разгуляться на широкую, Arcanum - это противостояние магии и технологии, в самом начале вы выбираете кем вам быть в этом неспокойном мире и от вашего выбора зависит всё, реально всё, начиная от реакции NPC на вас и заканчивая вашим снаряжением. Просто вдумайтесь 16 школ магии и в каждой по 5 заклинаний на любой вкус от простого опознания предмета и до призыва огненного элементаля или остановки времени. Технология это отдельный шарм игры, смиритесь с статусом побирушки, потому-что все мусорные корзины вы точно обыщите, всего 8 дисциплин в которой находятся целая тонна рецептов, начиная от отмычек и заканчивая броней со встроенным двигателем. Следует также отметить, что вы в праве просто создать героя в стиле обычного война или вора и послать нахер все эти школы и дисциплины и спокойно собрать всё что не прибито к полу.

Атмосфера в игре удивительная, на первых порах вы не прочувствуете, но попав в Тарант или Дернхольм ощутите весь спектр эмоций, более не скажу ничего. 

Задания в игре это настоящие истории и последствия ваших решений будут очень весомыми. Не хочу выдавать спойлеры, но чисто пример на Туманных холмах(самое первое поселение) для него предусмотрено более трех вариантов развития сюжета, а это даже не город.

Музыка - это просто шедевр, вся музыка тут исполнена струнным квартетом, охх эта виолончель и скрипка....

Господа, Вам однозначно необходимо ознакомиться с этим шедевром, ибо этот широкий спектр эмоций пропускать нельзя.

"E’ difficile per me parlare di Arcanum senza farmi prendere da una certa nostalgia. Il ricordo delle lunghe peregrinazioni pomeridiane (e notturne) nelle sconfinate terre di Arcanum rovistando trai rifiuti, nei negozi, nelle periferie delle città in cerca di qualche rudere abbandonato che nascondesse al suo interno oggetti rari, qualche erba per preparare degli ungenti, o alla ricerca di qualche personaggio strampalato per completare una quest. 
In Arcanum è facile imbattersi in una bottiglia di vetro in un cestino dei rifiuti e farne una molotov, o fare un fucile lancia-coltelli con delle parti di pistola, un tubo di ferro e dei coltelli, appunto.
Quasi tutto quello che si vede sul monitor, in Arcanum, si può manipolare o ci si può interagire. E tutte le quest, o comunque la stragrande maggioranza di esse, possono essere affrontate in modi diversi o addirittura opposti. E lo svolgimento della trama non è per nulla lineare: si può fare tutto ciò che si vuole, quando si vuole e come lo si vuole.
Se queste possono sembrare piccole cose adesso, features presenti in quasi in tutti i GdR, o almeno quelli di un certo livello, bisogna considerare che Arcanum è un gioco uscito nel 2001 all’ombra di titoloni GdR ben più noti come i due Baldur’s Gate, Torment e compagnia. 
Paragonato al miglior GdR attualmente disponibile sul mercato PC, Divinity Original Sin 2, tralasciando la componente tecnica (parliamo di 17 anni di differenza), Arcanum stravince sulla vastità e la diversità del mondo di gioco, sul crafting (in Arcanum molte armi si possono guadagnare solo creandole, e per creare un’arma bisogna sviluppare quel ramo specifico di specializzazione: esplosivi, armi da fuoco, spade, archi, eccetera). 
Non esiste un vero sistema di classi in Arcanum, c’è piuttosto una tendenza che avrà il nostro personaggio verso una o più caratteristiche. I punti esperienza possono essere investiti in abilità (Armi da fuoco, Mischia, Mercanteggiare, Persuasione), punti caratteristiche del personaggio (Forza, Destrezza, Carisma) o nell’albero delle tecnologie/magie. In questo modo si delineerà la classe del nostro personaggio, che potrà essere un Mago evocatore abile nel mercanteggiare o un Guerriero abile con la spada e con l’arco che all’occorrenza può usare anche armi da fuoco (archi e pistole, e tutte le armi a distanza in generale, diventano più efficaci aumentando lo stesso parametro, la percezione). Ed è su questa vastità e diversità che in Arcanum si ha completa libertà di approccio.  
Anche l’allineamento non viene definito a monte ma si modifica in base alle nostre azioni, al modo in cui concluderemo le quest e alla facilità con cui ricorreremo alla violenza. E non è raro che durante una singola partita si passi da un atteggiamento pacifico a uno più belligerante e malvagio o viceversa.
L’ambientazione ha poi un ruolo fondamentale. Il mondo steampunk di Arcanum è vivo, se ne palpano le contraddizioni, le meraviglie di Tarant e la decadenza delle altre città che non hanno voluto piegarsi all’incedere della tecnologia: il contrasto tra magia e tecnologia si sente tutto. 
Arcanum è a mio parere un gioiello dal gameplay unico, corredato da musiche che sono a mio parere tra le più belle mai realizzate per un videogame, e da una parte narrativa ottima.",1,1,0,15,0,2019-07-13,2019-07-13,770,10,2910,320
"3/10

I remember seeing Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magic Obscura on the shelves at stores when I was a teenager playing D2, SC:BW, and M & M, and always wanted to pick it up but never did.  I saw it on sale on Steam one time for cheap, and decided to finally check it out.  The game has some merits - the tech vs magick system is an interesting take on character building, the world is large enough and fairly immersive, there are some really interesting and compelling stories within the world (the half-ogre project, the treatment of orcs in society, etc.), and there is plenty of world to explore.  The biggest thing in Arcanum's favor is the sheer variety of ways you can play the game - play it evil or good, play it as an ugly brute or a beautiful diplomat, play it as a mage or a fighter.  Even the game itself works fine - the only bug that I encountered is that my Steam would occasionally determine that the game was running on its own, which put a few hundred hours into my time played on Steam and required me to restart my PC in order to successfully start the game for reals.  That said, I did play the game with a variety of improvements - the high-def packs, the unofficial patch, follower mod, ArcanumEdit, etc.  

However, I was overall unimpressed with a number of systems and elements within the game to such a degree that I can't recommend the game overall.  Inventory is cumbersome and finicky, travel is unintuitive in several regards, combat feels often very binary (you wreck the opponent or the opponent wrecks you, no in between), the tech/crafting piece of the game is utterly unclear and unapproachable without reading extensively outside of the game on how it actually works, and there are dozens of minor mechanics and conventions within the game that are never made clear in any sort of effective manner.  I tried playing the game legit for a length of time but finally gave up because of a number of the minor nuisances that were killing any enjoyment I got out of the game and ended up just following a walkthrough and some playing with ArcanumEdit to speed through the remainder of the game.  

Here's some spoiler-free nuisances that really detracted from the quality of the game overall.
- In combat, until your characters are melee masters, they frequently get disarmed.  This means that as you're bouncing around through a variety of combat encounters, your characters drop their weapons on the ground, and your other followers may pick them up.  You then have to go sorting through everyone's inventory to go get your weapon back, re-equip the correct weapons, etc.
- Also in combat, there are a variety of enemies who do significant damage to your weapon or armor, usually encountered in clusters within dungeons.  These guys chew through your equipment in an unreal fashion, destroying your good equipment (unless you finagle with inventory even more than necessary already to keep some backup gear for fighting such monsters...  which requires you to be using walkthroughs to know when these guys are coming).  By the way, repairing equipment (unless you yourself are a master repairman) quickly and significantly damages the maximum durability of items too.
- The journal in game that tracks quests is very unclear about who wants what and where they are.  You really need to take notes.  Why have a journal if it's going to be missing these things?  Even the later Might & Magic games that preceded Arcanum had good worthwhile auto-journaling.  
- Followers gain a level when you do, rather than having their own experience.  As a result, they will never catch up to you in levels, if they are recruited below your own level.  You're level 15 and just went and found that guy who is level 5?  Sorry, he'll be 10 levels behind you forever.  This was something I fixed with ArcanumEdit, once I got my party set up and realized that they were never getting any closer to my level, I just used that to edit my followers and raise their levels accordingly.
- Speaking of followers, you don't get to control how they apply their character points as they level up.  They follow their own auto-levelling scheme, even if it's not actually what you want or how you want them to be.  Want that guy to use a gun so that he's not getting his face stabbed all the time in melee?  Too bad, unless you go and edit the follower in ArcanumEdit or you recruit him early and then use the FollowerEditor program to deactivate (or re-assign) the autolevelling scheme so you can choose whether those character points are spent on a spell or a tech or a skill.  

Overall, I cannot recommend Arcanum in the year 2019.  I know I would've been happier with this game in some ways 20 years ago when I was in my early teens and looking at it on a store shelf, but I still would've found it lacking and in many ways frustrating compared to some of the high-end PC games that were out at the time.  That comparison has only grown worse in the 20 years that have passed since, such that I don't think I could've strongly recommended it in 1999 either.  I kind of don't like saying that, because there was definitely some worthwhile ideas and elements here, but especially at this point in time, whatever time this game might've had has definitely and irrevocably passed.  Unless you're really a junkie for old-school 90's RPGs, skip it and go elsewhere.",0,1,0,20,2,2019-07-10,2019-07-10,235,79,33837,33837

"Я люблю старые игры не из-за принципа ностальгии,а из-за их качества.Раньше игры действительно были лучше и останусь при этом мнении кто-бы что не говорил.Но эта игра - она исключение.
Узнал я об этой игре на YouTube,очень понравилась ролевая система,диалоги,геймплей и мне захотелось в нее поиграть.Решил сначала попробовать пиратку,вдруг игра себя не оправдает и я зря заплачу деньги.Скачал сборку с кучей патчей как ""Grand Fix"", ""Resolution Patch"" и т.д,но изменений от фикса я не обнаружил,а resolution patch вообще с корнем игру ломает.
Начал подозревать что пираты сделали свою сборку поломанной и уже пошел в стим покупать лицензию.Я был вдвойне подавлен.Игра на англ языке,без каких либо русификаторов,хотя разрабы уже могли вшить локализацию от фаргус или от иных людей,но нееееее,зачем.В самом начале игра начинает лагать от большого кол-ва объектов(деревья,трава),заметно снижая фпс.Не подумайте,что комп у меня прямиком с каменного века,игра была сделана этими представителями.Даже открыв инвентарь и просто перебирая предметы начинает лагать курсор,не сразу появляется описание того или иного предмета.Очень начинает лагать в пещере на начальной локации с пещерными крысами.
Играть в ваниллу невозможно без патчей от сообщества,но и их установка очень непонятная,хотя устанавливаю все строго по инструкции и даже менял директорию игры специально,вдруг.
Проще уже найти нормальную сборку,что сложно, и играть без патча на разрешение,без сторонних модов,дабы не сломать эту игру.

The magic and mystique of this game holds up while the bugs and glitches have largely fallen away with time. 

My only nitpick is that I do seem to experience slow down after playing for 2 hours or so, but a quick Save/Exit/Restart seems to clear things up.

"Old but still kicking!

The character customization has a lot of options and variations for you to play. Every buff you can get from character background also has a backlash which prevents you from being omnipotent from the begining. But still the game has some broken builds [spoiler] (harm) [/spoiler]. The dialogue is fine and the plot can get you involved. Maybe not as thrilling as some other classic RPGs, has its moments though. The best mechanic in Arcanum is the balance between magick and technology.

"Obrovské RPG od bývalých tvůrců Fallouta. V době, kdy jsem hrával především izometrické cRPG hry patřilo a stále patří Arcanum jistě k tomu nejlepšímu. Potěšující je i to, že jde vlastní cestou a hratelnost ozvláštňuje ne až tak časté steampunkové zasazení kombinující magii a technologii. 

Samotná hratelnost nepřekvapí (jako vždy u Troiky je skvělá), ale neobvykle široká volba možností hlavního hrdiny již ano. Samozřejmostí je řada vlastností, potěší i dovednosti, jež se musí učit od různých postav světa Arcana, stejně tak možnost najmutí dalších hrdinů, kteří vám pomůžou na cestě po světě. Příběh zpočátku nepůsobí příliš komplikovaně, kdy po havárii Zeppelinu hráč získá od umírajícího gnóma prsten a má vyhledat jeho původního majitele, ale později pomalým tempem přeroste od lokálního problému ke celospolečenské pohromě. 

Jednou z hlavních předností je velikost celého kontinentu (ač například nalezení lopaty se v pozdější části stalo takřka neřešitelným problémem), a do jisté míry volné putování s řadou měst plných manufaktur s nelichotivými podmínkami zdejších zaměstnanců, trpasličí doly nebo elfí vesnice položená vysoko v korunách stromů. V téměř každé truhličce či městském odpadkovém koši se nachází něco, co se může později hodit na vytvoření předmětu. Stejná volnost je hráči dána i na vyřešení problému, kdy hned počáteční problém s bandity na mostu je možno vyřešit řadou cest. 

Arcanum je prošpikováno i detaily jako body reputace, donášením darů božstvu k jejím svatyním s následným zlepšením schopností nebo jen editor, který bohužel nebyl tak úspěšně komunitou přijat jako u konkurence. Pokud je nějaký důvod, proč se do hry pustit i dnes, pak je to jistě díky výbornému designu světa s možnou realizací vašeho herního alter ega. O čem svědčí i to, že jsem hru po dokončení rozehrál znovu a strávil s ní tak půl roku, což je pro mě věc více než raritní.

"У этой игры множество положительных отзывов, активное сообщество, адаптирующее её к современным требованиям и ореол легендарной классики.

Но я полагаю, что усреднённому ""обычному игроку"" игра никакого удовольствия не доставит, поэтому пишу негативный отзыв, чтобы предупредить неосторожных покупателей. Фанатское сообщество и ореол классики есть, например, у Майнкрафта - но его трудно назвать интересной игрой для большинства.

Дело не в графике или возрасте игры. Помню, как в начале нулевых я убрал диск с Арканумом в дальний угол, потому что намного интереснее было ещё раз пройти Fallout. Сейчас я подумал, что, возможно, был несправедлив - поэтому скачал игру, установил современный мод и начал заново. И понял, что всё-таки был прав.

Начну с того, что игра вышла в 2001 году. Эта дата говорит нам, что разработчикам прекрасно были известны три великих столпа жанра - Fallout, Baldur's Gate и Planescape:Torment. И это мы даже не вспоминаем о том, что разработчики сбежали из студии Interplay, которая и делала Fallout. Даже если бы они пришли с улицы - они всё равно уже должны были понимать, что такое удобный игровой интерфейс в изометрической игре. Уж после двухтысячного года это понимали практически все.

Кроме, как выясняется, авторов Арканума.

Может быть это был неудачный эксперимент. А может быть им просто было всё равно. Но игра совершенно неиграбельна в самом что ни на есть изначальном смысле. Минусы валятся на игрока мучительно огромным списком.

- Вместо ""пошаговой РПГ"" или хотя бы технологии ""паузы"" для раздачи команд мы получаем буквально реал-тайм сражения. Это, напомню, в игре, где людям хочется ходить по миру, разговаривать с NPC и выполнять квесты с помощью убалтывания персонажей.

- Работа с картой реализована из рук вон плохо. Вы не можете кликнуть на другой конец карты и ожидать, что игрок побежит туда. В Fallout за пять лет до этого смогли такое сделать, а здесь не смогли. Игрок может бегать только в пределах видимости карты.

- Система построения маршрута игрока - отдельная песня; нужно выбирать точки в пределах видимости, а потом нажимать на кнопку, чтобы игрок бежал по этому маршруту. Раздражающе и бесполезно, особенно на фоне реалтаймовых боёв.

- Внизу экрана якобы существует панель быстрого доступа. Но как она работает - непонятно. Казалось бы, есть у вас окошки, и в эти окошки можно поместить зелья и заклинания. Самым логичным будет назначить окошкам быстрого доступа цифровые клавиши 1-8, не так ли? Не так. Эти зелья надо кликать мышкой и перетягивать на персонажа. Ничего быстрого в таком быстром доступе нет.

- Инвентарь тоже совершенно адский - описание прочитать это целое приключение, однотипные предметы не группируются, сравнить тоже не получится.

- В игре нет никакой обратной связи по действиям. Например, ты не видишь зону перехода в другую локацию, пока не забежишь в неё и не увидишь изменение иконки карты вверху. Ты не знаешь, где радиус видимости, когда ты крадёшься. Даже радиус заклинаний не виден.

- Это РПГ, в которой разговоры читать СЛОЖНО. Я напоминаю, что диалоги - суть РПГ, что вся графика это лишь обёртка, а главное - в том, что мы читаем. И что же мы читаем? И как же мы читаем? Реплики персонажей вылезают прямо рядом с ними малюсеньким шрифтом; наши реплики вылезают таким же шрифтом над ""панелью быстрого доступа"", посмотреть полный предыдущий диалог негде, специального окна для диалогов нет как класса. Это типа такая ""реалистичность""? На мой взгляд больше похоже на халтуру.

Ну и несколько минусов, которые были нормой для тех лет, но сейчас уже раздражают:

- Система квестов ""поди туда не знаю куда"". В то время было популярно (вот вспомнить хотя бы Морровинд), но на самом деле крайне тупо, потому что нужно заходить в каждый дом и смотреть, что там внутри. Поначалу может и интересно, а потом уже бесит. И ведь даже прозрачных крыш, как в Fallout, не завезли.

- Невероятно убогая система реакции персонажей в бою: если ты случайно попал по союзнику, союзник становится врагом и начинает в тебя стрелять. Тоже было в Fallout, но только если ты специально выстрелил по союзнику. Здесь же случайное попадание всё ломает.

- ""Опознание магических предметов"". Вкусовщина, конечно, но мне никогда не нравилось. Может быть уместно для подобранного на поле боя оружия, но если я покупаю предмет в лавке, то уж наверное продавец способен рассказать, что он продаёт.

Подводя итог - в игре неудобно ни читать, ни сражаться. Интерфейс совершенно нежизнеспособный. Игра может понравиться только группе фанатов, которые именно такое и любят. Для обычного игрока это и не РПГ, потому что атмосфера совершенно убита боёвкой, и не аркада, потому что боёвка совершенно убита интерфейсом.

Я никому не рекомендовал эту игру в начале нулевых, не рекомендую и сейчас. Она не заслуживает больше 3 из 10.

"Получилось так, что в свое время я пропустил столь замечательную игру...
Ну точнее я в нее играл, но только по сети, не проходя сюжетку.

Ну... И в 2019 мне удалось поиграть в эту прекрасную игру.
Играл в нее после прохождения свежей игры под названием ATOM (клон фаллаута).

Так вот... Хочу отметить, что arcanum похож на fallaut своей проработанностью, свободой действий, большой картой, прекрасно прописанными персонажами. Каждый спутник - это дополнение к главному герою. 
Города исполнены очень интересно, побочных квестов просто навалом. Все разнообразные, практически каждый квест можно пройти разными путями.

Проходил игру магом. Видел кучу рецептов, понимаю что игра за война или технолога - совсем другое. А есть ведь еще смешанные типы прокачки. 

Играть в оригинальную игру сейчас тяжко (ибо интерфейс занимает 40% от экрана). Поэтому очень рекомендую играть в дополненную фанатами версию - Arcanum Multeverse Edition (отлично ложится поверх Steam'овского Arcanum, ну и плюс там локализация более полноценная и дополненная)

Из удивительного: 
1. Нереально крутая прокачка. Можно выбирать судьбу, менять судьбу персонажа, натворив что-нибудь масштабное в мире. Каждое действие отражает на судьбе.
2. Мастера. Есть учителя для всего. И даже можно стать магистром какой-нить школы магии. А можно на все это забить. 
3. Юмор. В диалогах просто куча юмора. Герой, в зависимости от прокачки, выдает просто нереальные варианты в диалогах ) У меня был маг, но вести себя как быдло он тоже умеет )
4. Варианты действий. Тут ну просто тьма вариантов решения любой задачи. Можно воровать, пролезать в окна, ждать когда все уйдут спать. Открывать все с помощью соратников, ломать предметы/двери, запечатывать двери магией, открывать двери магией и тд )
5. Путешествия. Очень интересно исследовать карту. Много интересных случайных встреч, много интересный мест, которые по размерам как полноценные локации.
6. Быстрая прокачка персонажа. Я прошел игру за 65 часов. Получил 50-ый лвл. Путешествовать было комфортно (телепорт) и крошить всех направо и налево. Нет нудятины. Нужен опыт - есть куча вариантов как его достать
7. Развлечения. Ну тут такое... Можно делать много интересного. Бордели, воровство, можно ходить и выпендриваться на честной народ ) Поиграть в кости, погулять на дальних берегах...
8. Отношения. Есть тут метр отношения персонажа к вам. Я играл за мага-человека. Примерно с середины игры меня начали жутко чмырить технологи во всех городах )) Это интересно. Посмотрев отзывы в инете, понял, что тут чмырят всех.
9. Сюжет. Просто отличная сюжетная линия, было очень интересно узнавать че ваще происходит. Не нудный. Правда местами стало надоедать, что все ноют )) Но может мне так показалось. Все тут блин раскаиваются и ноют. Но никто не заставляет их слушать. Можно надавать лещей всем.

Из недочетов:
1. Не удобная карта... Ну точнее прокрутка карты. Хотя после нескольких часов игры уже так не парило. Особенно с телепортом.
2.  Придурковатый бег. Кривовато реализовано перемещение и поиск пути у персонажа. Частенько подлагивает, особенно на сложных локациях.
3. Ну и всякие мелочи интерфейса, к которым быстро привыкаешь.

Итог: Если не играли в Arcanum - бегом играть. Мелкие недочеты списываются за счет качества игры. Вот это реально похоже на fallout. Тут реально интересно. Тут реально есть что делать. Реально от выбора игрока многое зависит. Да что там многое - ВСЕ. Не знаю как я пропустил эту игру в свое время. Жутко жалею что не насладился ей раньше.

Вот сейчас прошел ее на скорую руку (60-70 часов это мало). Но теперь это одна из моих любимых игр. Буду проходить еще )
Всем удачи! )",1,1,0,8,0,2019-05-02,2019-12-03,0,49,4264,4264

"I did enjoy similar games like [b]Fallout[/b], [b]Fallout 2[/b] and [b]Planescape: Torment[/b]. They made me change my opinion about oldschool RPGs from negative to positive. And another [i]Troika's[/i] game [b]Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines[/b] is one of my favourite RPGs of all time. So, I was expecting at least an interesting story from [b]Arcanum[/b].
Yet, I can't see myself finishing this game. 
Not because of the old graphics, they are not the point of these oldschool RPGs.
Not because of the simplistic combat system. I can tolerate that.
Not because of the bugs, because the patches pretty much fix them.
Not because I have to use Google all the time to search info on how to complete quests and how things work in this game. That's kind of a standard for old games.
But because of the story, which is what every fan is praising it for.

It's just boring to me. I have finished almost all quests in the first three towns in this game and some additional areas, and I didn't find any quest interesting. They all are pretty much fetch quests. I feel lack of cohesiviness and context to my actions and it doesn't seem that it will get better. Everything just seems so disconnected.

The freedom and versatility of character development in terms of skills, moral alignment and magical vs technical aptitude seems promising, but it also looks like that this game has bitten more than it can chew. It's just not delivered in a fun, balanced and easy understandable way.

Inventory management is also a chore, even with the companions that you can use as pack mules.

Perhaps the only really praiseworthy aspect of this game that I'd like to point out is the beautiful soundtrack.

But that's not really a reason to play a game, is it? A good story would be the minimum I would expect from an RPG. But it's simply not there. The gameplay is just a drag.

I can only recommend this game to people who like games with a strong role-playing aspect (""strong"" as in ""you have to make the story in your head"") with almost absolute freedom of choice and multiple possible builds and who don't mind the old graphics.

"Поистине легендарная игра, на которую стоит потратить время, вне зависимости, младше вы её, или же вы поглаживали свою седую бороду, проходя мимо прилавка с пиратской копией этой игры в момент её выхода.

Классический изометрический геймплей, знакомый фанатам первых частей Fallout. (сам я не фанат такого геймплея, но возращаюсь в него временами только из-за Арканума)

Настолько же проработанные диалоги (""Извини за кровь на твоих ботинках, но смерть грязна""). Викторианская вежливость соседствует с особым цинизмом, образуя собой контрастный дуэт, из которого то и дело хочется добавить несколько фраз в свой речевой запас.

Великолепно проработанный оригинальный мир, подобных которому сложно найти. Вместо каких-либо описаний, лучше просто этим проникнуться самому.

Реиграбельность - когда ты не можешь выбрать что-то одно, потому что и магия, и технология по своему завораживают, и требуют своего стиля игры. На одной чаше 16 школ магии, в которых можно запутаться, в которых есть то, что кажется абсолютно бесполезным, и есть то, ради чего ты быстрее бежишь набирать опыт, лишь бы получить это в свой арсенал, и побыстрее. А с другой настоящая погоня за сборкой всех тех самых технических штук, которыми славится стимпанк. Каждая шестерёнка, каждая пружина будет носиться с особой бережностью в инвентаре, потому что рано или поздно, придёт её час, лишь бы хватило места в инвентаре на всё.

Даже выбор расы даёт тебе не просто какой-то бонус, как бывает в современных играх, а полностью определяет отношение мира к тебе. Для примера, беря полуорка и не вкачивая ему каких либо особенностей, касающихся диалога, вы будете часто сталкиваться с тем, чтобы уговорить собеседника на разговор, если конечно фразы, брошенные им, не заставят вас схватиться за оружие. А так и недалеко до того, чтобы убить какого-нибудь важного персонажа. Впрочем, кого бы вы ни убили, это не помешает вам пройти игру, всегда найдется альтернативный путь.

Ни одна рецензия в мире не опишет все возможности этой игры, поэтому, чёрт возьми, просто попробуйте.

Я снимаю свою Тесла-шляпу перед разработчиками. Таких игр больше не делают.

"Арканум была моей первой изометрической рпг и на мой взгляд является лучшей из “классических” рпг, да и вообще лучшей из всех рпг в которые я играл. Писать подробный обзор о всех аспектах игры не вижу смысла ибо игра вышла в 2001 году и обзоров на нее написано дохрена и больше, по этому дальше будут просто мои воспоминанию и ностальгия.

   Я был школьником когда ко мне попал диск с игрой от ""Фаргуса"" и к тому моменту я уже играл в NWN и примерно знал чего ожидать от игры. В отличие от того NWN где у меня первое время получались персонажи сплошь криворукие калеки, в Аркануме с созданием персонажа я сразу разобрался, я создал дварфа технолога/стрелка и игра мне четко показала, что для стрелковых навыков нужно Восприяние, а для прокачки технологий нужен Интеллект. Ветки магии я даже не смотрел. Помню как при каждом визите в Тарант первым делом бежал обшаривать мусорки на предмет хлама для крафта патронов, кремниевых пистолетов и револьверов на продажу, потом бежал по магазинам смотрел не продают ли там новых схем для изучения... потом уже все остальное. У меня была идея фикс, я был маньяком технологом, моему рвению собрать и изучить все технологии в игре позавидовали бы даже самые фанатичные слуги Бога Машины!

Is this a game that focuses on story, or combat, well that's largely up to you. Are there essentially character classes, a karma system, dialog trees, and some big bad evil guy to beat at the end, again the answer is a resounding sort of, but not really. I think at the end of the day, the highest praise I can award this game is, that if I was forced to live on an island for the rest of my life with one game and one game only, I would choose Arcanum. The possibilities are truly endless with this overlooked gem of a game.",1,1,0,10,1,2019-02-08,2019-02-08,0,44,3089,3004

My favorite game ever.  Unfortunate that it is too buggy to play as is. Shouldn't have to download wraps or unofficial patches. Sad.,0,1,0,6,1,2019-02-06,2019-02-06,0,5,2008,1103
"Ok. After few tries finally passed the game. I was reading that Arcanum is one of best RPGs ever, which is kinda true. It is interesting that although Skyrim is open world like Arcanum, you have feeling that Arcanum NPCs have more soul. Also depending from your intelligence, charisma, beauty or race, the talk with NPC can go to totally other way. 

Before you play this game on Steam, you have to know that original game was full of bugs. SO go to ""guide section"" of this game on steam, and use instructions and install fan made patch MultiVerse edition. With this patch, you will have bugs removed, game more balanced, and graphics improved. Dont forget to turn-off some anti-viruses(during installation or play) , to avoid crushing the game . After you made this, you can really enjoy playing. 


So first i ll  talk about negative aspects of game. Bugs - however with fan made patches, 95% of bugs are removed. If you get sometimes bug, for example you hero stuck after the fight or in fight, just go to option and switch to real time fight , then return to turn based fight and you are fine. I didn't notice much other bugs, so fan made patch was great. 

Now second negative aspect - it is fighting system. For me, i get used to it, it is fine, but people are talking that it is unfinished. Use turn based fights, sometimes you can combine with real time. You need some times to get perfect in those fights , after few hours you should master fighting system and you will be fine.  So bugs -mostly fixed , fight system -not that bad.

Now focus on game. Its amazing. Huge world. 2million of square kilometers of territory - although its mostly empty.  However there are huge amount of quests that can go different way. NPC that you feel like they are real persons, especially some followers. I finished the game, and follower Raven before last fight said that she has fall in love with me <3 . Probably bcause i invested some points into beauty and i was half-elf and good align . 
You can be evil guy, rob stores, steal their property and magical items, do nasty things , and gather crew of evil followers. You can be mage (i think it is easiest way to win), or you can be knight with magical swords, or engineer with master degree in mechanics and electrical engineering or explosives and guns . 
I never seen other game offering that much variety. Also before you start the game, you have so much races, ""background stories"" (for example poor guy with more strength but less money, or raised by monks or you can start as super-model with high beauty and charisma and walk through game by talking with people, or you can play as stupid half ogre). Also game is hard. Very hard for fist time playing arcanum. Also it will be almost impossible to pass it alone first time, so my advice use on-line guides to help you about some quests. You can follow main story, and go around. For example when you reach early capital city , dont go straight for main quest. Clean the sewers , it will be hard but you will get few levels and lot of bounty that will make than main quest easier. 


Anyway i can talk all day about this game, it is amazing, one of the best RPGs ever made. Some stuffs made in this game are still unparallel to any other game even almost 20years latter.  I finished game as a good mage, fallen in love with Raven NPC, had sex orgy in StillWater village after i finished one quest, maybe i ll try now as Engineer.  Install fan made update that you can find on steam, (turn off antivirus while installing and playing) and use help of online forums when get stuck. I played this and Skyrim and i found Arcanum more interesting (Skyrim is great game tough)",1,1,0,37,0,2019-01-28,2019-01-28,0,9,75,75
"Когда-то игры делали не за ради биржевых спекуляций с фондой издателя и сверхприбылей, а потому что было, что сказать миру, чем поделиться, во что обратить. Потому и чувствуется в игре душа: в стиле, в дизайне, в лоре, в диалогах, в замыслах. Саундтрек до сих пор, наверное, самый яркий их всех игр — мало какой ost вспомнят через почти 20 лет.
Сейчас стало модно говорить об «усталости от Голливуда» — что, в общем-то, и понятно, — однако ж, учитывая всё разрастающуюся когорту аудитории геймеров (которые уже перестали быть маргиналами, становясь фактически социальной нормой), впору говорить об усталости от Трипл (мать их) Эй издателей, клепающих унылое гмо строго в плановом режиме. 
Главное в другом. Как бы сейчас ни расстраивала графика в Аркаше или в Фолле, но только представьте, что нужно было вложить в проект, чтобы закрыть на неё (графику) глаза, дать волю воображению и снова пройтись теми же тропами, встречая не персонажей, а старых знакомых.

P.S. Конечно же, играть без внешних патчей нельзя. И несмотря, что нынешний карабас в лице активижн к игре имеет самое косвенное отношение, покупка сего чуда геймдева — это голос против опостылевших стопицотых батлфилдов, ассасинов и недоразумений76",1,1,0,93,1,2019-01-23,2019-01-23,0,5,34,17

"This is an amazing RPG. It is an older game so of course it has out dated graphics but that shouldn't matter. This is an amazing game with a ton of stuff to do in it. You can choose to be good or evil depending on your actions. You can be a sword wielding knight, a gunslinger, a tech wiz, a wizard, or many other things. The game doesn't really give you much guidance but that is because it wants you to explore and talk to everyone to slowly learn the lore and uncover the story. You can go around and steal from people's houses or go and slay monsters that are attacking people. You can choose to rob a bank or defend it. The character creation is fun as well. You pick your race and then your personality to determine your stats at the start of the game. A guide helps a ton in this game so you know where to find all the recruitable characters. The inventory system makes it tough to loot anything and everything. The inventory system is a grid or a certain amount of squares and each item takes up a certain amount of squares in the inventory so you got to do some crazy tetris magic to make sure you keep all the good stuff. The one thing I love most about this game is the soundtrack. The developers put together their own symphony of some of the greatist musicians at the time to create some amazing songs for the game. They put a lot of effort to make the music epic but fit the area your in. I would say this is a game I would highly recommend trying. Great music, great combat system, a decent challenge so you actually have to think about what you want to do first, and just all around fun.",1,1,0,9,0,2019-01-18,2019-01-18,0,24,14,13

"Alright, I don't do many reviews.  But, I have loved this game since I saw it's add in a magazine a year before its release, and even with its delay.  I will say this is my #1 RPG.  So know, there might be some bias in this review, but I will speak of it as impartial as I can.

I will say, I had encountered a few bugs before.  I got trapped in a dungeon, with no escape, because of one before.  At times, it will glitch as well, like the screen not going black at the brothel, so you get in the room, and just fall down.  Small things like that.

Combat seems to be peoples biggest complaints.  I play the game almost exclusivly in RT mode.  In RT, some things suffer.  Also, the combat AI for opponents is pretty repetative (in RT).  They pretty much charge at you, or shoot at you if they ranged.. and thats it.  Kill a guy attacking you, the others suddenly run off a bit, then return.  Rinse Repeat.  In this fashion and mode, Ranged Characters suffer some, and many spells are kinda pointless.  Also, there are areas that will kick your teeth in with their difficulty.  This is most prevalent in the dungeons.  Part of this is due to the fact, while in the overworld map, if you or your allies are low on fatigue due to casting or battle, you can wait an hour and get fully rested.  You won't heal, but you will gain fatigue.  In dungeons, you can not wait.. which means you need to use tonics.. or just wait in RT for it to heal naturally.  There are also creatures that are SUPER annoying to fight.  Golems are the worst.  They aren't unkillable, but it takes a bit of finess.

The other complaint is the balance.  Best character in the game?  Master Melee/Dodge with sword and shield.  You can kill anything in the game by endgame with almost no trouble.  As a mage, it takes a bit more work, as you have to manage your Fatigue, which many enemies actually attack.  But even still, Mages are far 'easier' then Tech characters.  For one, the first companion is a mage.  He is also a healbot.  If your tech savvy, then it is quite possible his spells will fizzle, thus not healing you, wasting his fatigue, and all around causing problems.  This makes the early game harder.  Also, the one other issue with Tech users in the core game.. is the avalibility of components.  Most things you can 'learn' through your points, are fairly common to find.  However when you start getting into some of the complex ones that you find throughout the game, they become a bit more rare.  There are Items in this game that I have never built because I never found the component.  At least not without an Editor, which I used before with my core copy.  So while Tech is far harder to play, I enjoy the fact that it does CHANGE the way the game plays out.  Also, its old school in the sense you can't just click to win no matter your build... as they all have their own strength and weaknesses.

Now, the positives.

Story.  It has an amazing main plot.  The main plot, doing none of the hundreds of side quests, will take days to finish, and takes you all across Arcanum.  It also is amazingly written.  Virgil, your first companion, has his own questline.  Most of the Voiced companions, have their own little quests, but Virgils is by far the most extensive.  The story moves and evolves.  How you LEARN that story, is where the change comes in.  You are an ugly Ogre that everyone attacks on site? (Which is not an exageration) and kill a questgiver that is essental?  There are other ways to learn about it.  I am currently trying to run through the whole game as a huge idiot.  I have never done the whole game that way.. so I can't say just how much the story changes when you can't ask questions like other characters.  But some of the dialog is HILARIOUS.  

Sidequests: Ok, the game is a true open world once you pass the 'tutorial' town.  I say that, because there is a quest you must complete before you can move onto the rest of the world.  There are, as I have discovered, 3 ways to complete this quest... and some are far easier then others.  Also, in this 'tutorial' area... you can easily die.  Just because you survived a blimp crash doesn't mean your invincible.  But, in the tutorial town, there are over a dozen quests.  Some are easy, and take place in town.  Others require you go elsewhere.  Some build up in time.  And some require you to have certain skills.  Then you go into the world proper, and there are NO restrictions.  You can go ANYWHERE you want.  There is not always things there, but usually it always has at least one quest to do. 

Character Creation/Intergration:  Character Creation is one of the easiest but most elaborate system I have seen.  Stat system is a bit different, and you get bonuses for having a 20 in the stat.  Like having 20 CON makes you immune to poison. 20 STR doubles your damage.  Its a very fun system.  As for your intergration in the game.. it actually puts you in the game.  Your inital reaction is based on your beauty and Race, and reputation and alignment.  Talking is based on your charisma.  Sometimes, being a simpleton aids you as people take pity on you.  Other times, people ignore you, or use you, like the constable.  His first quest could net you 500 gold I believe at most.  However, if your an idiot, he gives you 20.  Other people refuse you talk to you all together.",1,1,0,1,0,2018-12-24,2018-12-24,149,3,3885,177

"Arcanum, я считаю - это одна из ограниченного числа жемчужин мира видеоигр. В далёком 2001 году, 2 человека сочиняли ""игру своей мечты"" и у них это получилось!!!
Взять мир технологии и мир магии, рассорить их, перемешать, затем завернуть в обёртку паро-панка и полить густым соусом из продуманных и интересных диалогов, запоминающихся персонажей и маломальским сюжетом вот, готово!
Вкуснятина! Дайте две!
Мало игр предлагают такую свободу выбора, какая даётся в этой игре. Хочешь будь негодяем, хочешь - героем, хочешь дуболомом, хочешь умником... Можно всего по чуть-чуть.
Если коротко то: ""Отыгрыш роли РЕАЛЬНО ЧУВСТВУЕТСЯ в этой игре"".

Единственное, что сильно огорчает, что в мире игростроя редко кто может позволить себе создать ""игру-мечту"" в том виде, в каком её хочется видеть на все 100 %. В мире ещё тогда, деньги решали и теперь решают всё. 
Игра вышла ОЧЕНЬ СЫРОЙ и недоработанной, куча багов и глюков наблюдается в игре и по сей день, несмотря на имеющиееся патчи. Из-за давления руководства, разработчики банально не смогли её доделать до логического конца.
Да, вы можете пройти игру до конца и сейчас, но без надлежащего комфорта.

В заключении хочется сказать, что хоть конторы разработчиков больше нет, но Arcanum до сих пор продолжает полироваться и совершенствоваться благодаря поклонникам-энтузиастам. Баланс улучшается, механики выправляются, есть куча доп.модулей и русская локализация текста и это радует. Хотя всё ещё частенько у игроков возникают проблемы.

"A truly patrician choice. 

The soundtrack has haunted me since I was a small child working in the steel mill. It is by far the most mature and engrossing soundtrack in a role-playing game created for the computer. 

1800’s setting mixed with fantasy dungeon and dragons, the world of Arcanum is indeed still a post-apocalyptic RPG, however it is not nuclear fallout, but indeed, the ideals of the world as we know it are over. The idea of steam engines meeting spells has been a setting I have longed to return to, alas the world as we know it now in 2018 has left Arcanum and its intellectual property behind. 

First and foremost, the character creation is the most flexible in a CRPG to date. Gone are the days now whereby one may create a character, but by no act of their own input points into the wrong attributes and skills, found themselves a character that has no practical skills and is lost to the wilderness in the first area. 

Critics over the last eighteen years have spoken of the idea of balance, apparently a gunslinger type character will be underpowered in low levels but overpowered once they have invented the elephant gun or repeater rifle. This point is moot. Life is unbalanced. I have come to embrace games that are out of balance. Rather than complain about a loop hole, exploit that loop hole and I will promise you, you will find yourself escaping the blank mountain mines party fully intact. 

Like with other Troika games, the unofficial patch saves the game. And the game is indeed playable and completable. 

My gripe with this game is not the unbalance or bugs, as the reviewers of the last twenty years will have you read. The game just isn’t that polished and fleshed out. The setting demands more attention and I found the world emptier than I remembered it. Still, it is an important addition to the CRPG compendium.",1,1,0,18,0,2018-12-04,2018-12-04,0,12,131,67

Played it a lot in my younger years. I recommend playing in fast-turn based mode. The combat in this game can be a real hassle if you are playing in real-time, and a bit to slow with regular turn based.

"If you liked Fallout 1 and/or 2, this game is definitely worth a try.

I've got Arcanum on GoG and now Steam, and both are patched to 1.7.0.4 which is the latest official patch of the game.

The UAP (Unofficial Arcanum Patch) by drog fixes almost everything that's within the scope of possibility without the source code on hand, and is definitely worth using. Additionally, for the ultimate Arcanum vanilla experience, I highly recommend Arcanum: Multiverse Edition. It fixes bugs I was not even aware of and makes some much appreciated tweaks to certain mechanics in the base game, fully fleshing out technology schematics and generally just a lovingly crafted quality of life improvement overall. It has a configurator to easily apply resolution changes, checkbox toggling of certain options provided by popular mods and is available in both English and in Russian.

Other big overhauls worth checking out with more drastic changes to the base game include A:WIP and Carcanum, both of which I also recommend trying at some point. With the communities that have sprung up around this game over the years and the GoG and now Steam releases, it can be enjoyed by anyone interested enough to fire up a 2001 cRPG in the same vein as the original Fallout's. The soundtrack is largely completely performed by a string quartet, a creative choice by Ben Houge that mirrored the asynchronous nature of the conflict between magick and technology in the world of Arcanum- I enjoyed it and found it very fitting for the game.

"Firstly, the strengths.
An incredible experience for anyone who loves RPGs, and even a few who don't. Whether you love exploring the insanely flexible branching story, or just like mind controlling people and blowing things up with dynamite, the game is willing to let you have fun any way you want.

Play as a pure Charisma build and amass followers to be your meat shield. Study technology and wield tesla cannons, flaming axes, and build an army of robots to overwhelm your enemies. Study the arcane and summon elementals and demons, to tear apart your foes and then resurrect them as zombies. Neglect your intelligence and fumble through the hilarious dialog as the village idiot. Or study the ways of stealth and thievery, relieving poor fools of the very clothes off their back and shops of their precious earnings.

Truly, anything is possible in Arcanum, a game where lockpicks, fireballs, and dynamite are all viable options for opening doors, and where even major story characters are not safe from death (your followers, too). And with high-resolution patches, the graphics don't suffer so much on modern monitors.

Now to address the drawbacks.
Perhaps the largest issue, if not the most prominent, is that the world is perhaps [i]too[/i] open. There are a lot of huge questlines and bits of story and lore that won't become apparent unless you know exactly where to look, and the gameplay is super awkward until you figure out what works and what doesn't. Especially in the beginning, you might feel like you've picked the wrong build until you figure out how to make it work- there's a definite curve to some builds, and some drawbacks that you might not notice until it's too late.

I see gameplay is one of the most common complains about Arcanum, but I think it's mainly because we're used to games easing us into it. Arcanum will not do that. It will drop you into a world where even passing strangers stand a fighting chance until you attain some advanced skill, spell, or equipment. Multiple times, you will be forced to find alternative solutions when faced with an enemy you cannot punch or stab or Harm to death. I think this is a good thing, as there are always multiple paths to every solution! But it can be frustrating, especially if you don't invest in magick or tech healing from the outset. Just remember that holding shift and a hotkey will self-cast whatever is bound to it, be it a salve, potion, or spell, and casting on the follower portraits is much easier than trying to target them in the midst of battle!

I played this game to death in the early 2000's and there were still a few things I discovered in my most recent playthrough. You could go the whole game without realizing an entire alternate story path existed, or that the gnomes were secretly breedi-",1,1,0,42,1,2018-11-24,2018-11-24,0,29,753,456

"Рад, что эта игра появилась в Steam.
Первое знакомство с игрой произошло после покупки какого-то сборника пиратских ролевых игр и поначалу, я даже не сразу её установил, так как покупал диск не из-за этой игры (честно говоря, даже забыл из-за какой и диск покупал). Когда я до этой игры добрался, просто ушел на неделю в неё, настолько она оказалась захватывающей, что вполне смогла бы тягаться, по многим параметрам даже с Diablo 2.
Плюсы:
- Хороший сюжет
- Возможность выбрать готового персонажа, либо создать своего (для того времени, достаточно хороший набор кастомизации, даже без возможности настроить его внешний вид) 
- Наличие нескольких спутников 
- Возможность настройки боя (от пошаговой до атаки в реальном времени)
- Наличие кармы (добра и зла), которая влияет на сюжет и на возможность получения того или иного персонажа в свою команду. 
- Хорошо развитая и продуманная система диалогов
- Магия и технологии (можно прокачать эти ветки у своего персонажа)
- Могу ещё долго перечислять, но лучше самому сыграть в эту игру, однозначно, рекомендую!!! 
Без минусов не обошлось:
- На современных системах бывают вылеты, либо моменты, когда игра совсем не запускается, в целом, проблема решаема. 
- Отсутствие русского языка, так сказать, ""из коробки"", решаемо установкой Arcanum Multiverse Edition.
Если такие минусы вас не пугают и вы готовы к некоторым танцам с бубном при запуске (возможно и не потребуется), игра не должна разочаровать",1,1,0,8,1,2018-11-21,2018-11-21,796,15,30,26

"[h1] Retro Review[/h1] 
As a member of the merchants guild i was surprised when papa SsethTzeentach recommended this game. I immediately bought it and kinda tend to differ that it is a game i would recommend people.

[u] Gameplay[/u] 
One of the strongest and at the same time weakest points of Arcanum is the gameplay. On one hand you have a open world, tons of things you can skill, build, explore, solve quests in many ways, you get on the other hand a completely broken combat system. 

The combat is just one of the worst ive ever seen. You either choose real time(without a pause button) or turn based. Neither of them are in any way balanced, nor fun. At the beginning i switched between them, later on i just let the real time mode progress so my companions could auto kill the enemies. 

The turn based mode works  but is boring and unbalanced. Most of your spells are completely useless compared how broken the others are. Bows in real time mode shoot faster than a gatling gun and technology tree itself is only useful in mid/lategame which makes it totally obsolete because the only hard times you have in this game is the early and early midgame. 

Quests are annoying sometimes aswell. The game gives you 0 clues at some point and then you end up discovering in a guide that the person you search is in another town about 10 or 20 hours into the game later in some random house. So you end up looking into each house in every city you go if you didnt read a guide. Since there are mostly only npc´s who are just cosmetic its a tedious and boring task.

I encountered a bug that broke my savegame at the end of the game which made me watch a walktrough of the last part of the game despite i have patched everything with the fan patches.

[u] Story[/u] 
Arcanum offers a quite surprising twist at the end, otherwise it is your average story about an evil nemisis from the legends comes back again story. It kept you wondering if the prophecy is actually true or not. The twist tough is pretty good and will definetly make the story stand out a bit but its still nothing mind blowing. 

The world building of arcanum is interestening but only partially utilized. Technology ceases magic to work and vise versa. So if you are a mage you cant ride the first class train and some shopkeepers will kick you out of their store. Otherwise its not mentioned really and the struggle between technology and magic could have been told and utilized better.

[u]Aestethics[/u] 
In contrast to games like fallout or baldurs gate arcanum didnt age that well. Character models look pretty much alike and its impossible to distinguish between cosmetic npc´s and quest givers. Cities with technology are florishing while the other cities fall apart. Backgrounds look rather average while models of objects do look good.
The best part is probably the music and the voice acting. The main theme is a violin play that really got the renaissance feeling to it. It sounds beatiful yet depressing just as the ingame world. The voice acting is fantastic and i recommend to everyone to just listen to a few samples of them.


[u]Conclusion/TL;DR [/u] 
Arcanum is definetly not a must play because it doesnt offers a fantastic gameplay but has a mildly interestening  story and world building. It definetly lacks in many areas and is broken in combat. But it got a very interestening elements i didnt see before. Especially the almost untouched industrial revolution era in games. I would recommend this only to people who already played trough the old classic isometric rpg´s and crave some more and really dig the setting",0,1,0,6,2,2018-11-11,2022-04-26,373,580,4252,2750
"Geiles Spiel ohne Frage! Ich hab es immer geliebt und werde seiner immer in ehren gedenken!

The soundtrack is also really interesting, being entirely string quartet, and it's a good one. The few bad points I'd point out are that it only pretends to be open world: there's this huge world map that takes literal weeks of in-game time to traverse, but unless you're at a key location, there's absolutely nothing out there. Fun technical crafting system for Technology disciplines, opposite Magic(k), though Magick is objectively stronger in just about everything.

"Kvalitní RPG které bylo a je bohužel zastíněné velikány jako Fallout 1,2. Kombinace techniky a magie je velice inovativní věc a myslím že i do teď nemá  v podobném konceptu žádnou rivalitu.

The following review was written when I played a technologist:
Played for 23 hours and got to level 30

This is not a good game, period. I love the other 2 games of Troika (VTMB and TOEE), played them for hours. The problem with arcanum is not its world or its characters- in this department it seems to have huge potential. But even after the official and unofficial patch, the game is just irritating to play. The combat is terrible, and you can't avoid it. It took me sometimes hours to finish one dungeon, and it always means exploiting the weak AI and weird glitches. The graphics are low standard, even for the time period- it's not the quallity itself, it's the design- the game looks not even half baked, more like 20% baked. The music is of course beautiful- but sometimes it just doesn' fit the mood and can be irritating. 

Bottom line: a remake is in need. The game shows potenital, but right now it's just a chore play, no fun at all.",1,1,0,0,0,2018-09-21,2020-03-05,0,30,1634,1158
"Sadly, this game has a too poor performance, choking and freezing every second. This makes it unplayable.

Despite being an old game, it has a very poor usability; Every action seems to be hard and there are some unnecessary over complicated tasks. Learning how to move around between locations, for an example, should be something simple that took me half an hour.

It appears to have some nice mechanics and freedom of choice, which would be very interesting if the game was a little more playable. The story and the dialogs are just ok, and the environment is a little strange.

I understand it is a old game, and things were different. Still, talking about today, at least, this game needs too much force of will. You  probably have better options out there.

"A note on play time: I haven't played a lot of this game on Steam, but I played this game through several times in it's original form. The Steam edition (especially with cut-content mods, high-resolution patches, and official patches) is superior. I'm planning to play through this steam version soon, but only when I have the time. Most of my review is based on the original version, so your experience may vary. I'll probably update the review when I complete the game via Steam.

General: There is a substantial depth of lore within the game. Much of the lore affects the main character's reactions to events, abilities, and interactions with the people in the world. The implementation of magic vs. technology is effective, especially in how these two elements interact.

Characters/Combat: Player Character skills and attributes can be personalized a lot but this is, in many ways, a combat-oriented game. The combat system can be switched between real-time and turn-based on the go. Usually, if you have problems with a fight, you can enable turn-based and have more control over what happens and when. Even then, the action point calculations are cumbersome. Attempting to create a non-combat character can work but expect to run into problems if you are unable to defend yourself. Focusing solely on combat, however, brings with it it's own problems.

UI/Controls: Some of the UI and controls require getting used to. Some problems can be helped with key bindings, but much of the control scheme is outdated by today's standards. It reminds me of old-school computer RPGs (because it is one) before more robust control schemes were created. Expect to have to click and/or button press a lot to achieve certain results.

Graphics: The graphics are serviceable, but don't look that great. Some computers might experience problems with dropped frames and other issues. It's an old game.

Sound/Music/Speech: Some of the menu sounds (especially the 'error' sounds) are annoying. The music is generally good and the voice-acting is functional. (Edit: Playing through it a little now, the voice acting is better than I remember. Some of the character lines are actually very good, especially Virgil.)

Difficulty: Depending on character creation and upgrades, this can be an extremely difficult game. Don't expect to have your hand held throughout. Combat can be very frustrating. Expect to read and reread descriptions of everything (along with trial and error) to even have a chance of understanding the intricacies of this game.

Overall thoughts: It's worth a playthrough if you can get past the dated factor of the game. The story is well-conceived but requires a lot of work to piece together.

The first time I played though, I made the mistake of creating a melee character and didn't realize you actually had to out points into persuasion. So I restarted and created a firearms character, and began investing my points into persuasion and firearms. Combat is definitely this game's weak point and the graphics aren't the most amazing, but I could honestly care less about graphics and I can overlook the combat by setting it to easy and real time combat mode, which makes it a little less stressful. Overall the games flaws can be overlooked and it has great characters, story, and humor.",1,1,0,4,0,2018-08-22,2018-08-22,0,26,405,329
"Want to be straight forward with this one. It's such a classic for me, the game i grew up with, though at a time gore violence and language was too much for a child mind of mine. 
Choices matter, and usually, in a long run, what skills you invest in - matters a lot, so you have to think carefuly and plan ahead.
Dialogue options matter, some can give you a new friend, and others can insult the person to the point when he tries to murder you in cold blood, and sometimes you have an option to bluff your way out of the combat and gain a lot of new useful information.
Way of presenting your adventures and knowledge is very immersive aswell - you have a diary you put all your thoughts and progress into, always can turn to it when you think you missing something.
Tactics to combat, dungeons and other situations always differ, in order to be effective you have to adapt, so just rushing in is usually a bad idea, everything is sort of a puzzle, an ode to how people would actually act, how enemies would logically act.
Characters have character to them, their motives, stories to tell. If you care enough to listen. Story and the world you are in are very immersive and make sense.
Is it a bit unfinished? sure. So grab your self a few community patches beforehand, and immerse yourself in this world by thinking everytime ""What would I do in this situation, and which tools do I have to use to succeed"".

Эта игра цепляет всем.
2д графика?Пф, все здесь выполнено четкой кистью художников любящих свое дело, каждый город и любая местность запоминается и передает атмосферу и дух локации

"Despite being into cRPG's all my life, Arcanum never spoke to me back in the day. I gave it a second chance and I'm happy that Steam gives us the option to get a refund. Some reasons:
-required a ton of patching to make it work properly
-still had a ton of bugs after all the official and innoficial patches
-the music is kinda meh
-balance in this game is a myth- there are strategies that are better, and there are strategies that won't work because screw you for trying to be different
-and the thing that baffles me to no end- the game forces you to choose either technology or magic and actively punishes you if you even dare to achieve balance. No thank you.

I believe anyone who says the game has charm and becomes better if you give it more time, but I have no time for this shit anymore. You guys have fun, I'm out and still waiting for a good steampunk/fantasy RPG to come.",0,1,0,5,0,2018-08-12,2018-08-12,0,23,119,29

"The very first pc game I ever purchased. 
I devoured it. I LOVED it when I was 13 and I'm very happy my feelings didn't change at all!

Beside the huge amount of nostalgia I feel for this game ... 

Arcanum has a huge world. The main and side-quests are super fun to live through. You can be everything, make everything, beat the game in any way you like. Every decision is important to the ending. It has more synchron-actors than skyrim, though only one romance option. ... (Waited like 17 years for a certain romance mod *cough* never came and probably never will .. *big sigh* in my dreams, Virgil p_ò ... err.. anyways!)

- What might be a bit annoying to some is the music. I like chello music, but after some time it gets dull, the fighting music especially. But I guess given for it's age, it's a minor. 

- The huge world mentioned seems empty. There's a lot of space to be filled, dear community! Ô_Ô 
But if you enjoy running through forests, plains ect for hours without using the world map fast-travel .. Eh! Have fun :D *thumb up*

"Ne vous fiez pas à mes heures de jeu, j'ai acheté ce jeu sur CD il y a longtemps. Ce jeu fait partie de mes jeux de référence, avec BG2, NWN et n'importe quel fallout et maintenant POE2: deadfire et D:OS. J'aurais tendance à la mettre en premier d'ailleurs, car c'est le premier jeu que j'ai essayé avec du crafting, et pas n'importe lequel : avec un gameplay d'inventeur. 

Ce gameplay unique permet de combiner différents domaines scientifiques pour créer des objets très puissants, très variés, et dont on comprend la logique aisément. Le fait de combiner les objets 2 par 2 rend le crafting parfaitement compréhensible et stimulant. Plusieurs objets ont différentes variantes radicalement différentes selon le schéma et les ingrédients dont on se sert. Ce jeu a un des meilleurs gameplays que je connaisse, avec un système de crafting particulièrement réussi. 

Le système de magie est intéressant aussi, mais je dirais que la grande nouveauté et réussite de ce jeu est la branche technologique, que je cherche désespérément dans d'autres jeux, mais qui n'y est généralement représentée qu'à 10-20 % en termes de variété.

L'histoire est assez réussie également, mais je prends déjà un grand plaisir à amasser de l'or et collectionner les schémas. Il n'y en a d'ailleurs pas 56 comme c'est parfois dit, mais davantage encore avec les schémas multi-technologiques que l'on peut acheter ou trouver, et qui sont encore plus intéressants. Les 56 objets à crafter évoqués dans les reviews sont en fait ceux de base uniquement.

C'est un jeu peu cher qui plus est et particulièrement recommandé poru tout amateur de cRPG. Seuls les graphismes sont un peu viellots maintenant, mais la plupart des amateurs de cRPG pourront s'y habituer et passer un bon moment.",1,1,0,5,0,2018-06-16,2018-06-16,0,12,1629,285
"Fallout1~2の主要スタッフから構成されるTroika Gamesが開発し、2001年に発売されたRPG。
このゲームはとにかく選択の自由が多いのが魅力です。
例えば、盗賊が蔓延る橋の門を通れるようにするという超序盤の難所がありますが、クリア方法として盗賊を倒すか、盗賊からスリで鍵を奪うか、盗賊に協力して通してもらうか、盗賊に嘘をついて丸め込むかなど様々なアプローチが可能です。
その他のクエストでも解法が一つだけでなく、こんなやり方があったのかと驚くことが多いです。
キャラクタービルドも多岐に及ぶのでリプレイ性が高く、主人公の善悪によっては途中のメインクエストの流れも変わります。
また、グラフィックや音楽も独特で素晴らしく、定期的にこの世界に浸りたくなります。
欠点は戦闘が大味で、手に汗握る熱戦みたいなものはあまりないです。
しかし、それはこのゲームがアドベンチャー的な部分をより強調しているからかもしれません。
やり方によっては敵をほとんど殺さずにクリアすることも可能です。
古めなゲームですが、今プレイしても新しさを感じられると思いますので是非やってみてください。

"""I'll be the sickest necromancer in the fucking world dude, radical!""..
Those words. Those are how it started. Little did I know how it would end up..

I made my character, a sickly elf. Physicality of a frail, old, HIV-positive neighborhood pervert, but the mind of a supreme cosmic being.. I play a bit into the game, get better at the dark necromancy skill line, get some gear, pimp up my follower, I'm living life, doing quests.. I'm walking around the streets of Tarant. Suddenly I see a sign. ""Brothel"", it says.
Don't mind if I do!
So I enter the brothel, and talk to the old head mistress. She tells me all the prostitutes cost 100 gold. ""100 gold? Geez, that's steep, don't you have anything cheaper?"", ""Sure, for the most deviant of clientel, you can pay old Belle a visit for just 25 gold"". What a good deal, huh?
So I pay the 25 gold, enter Belle's room, and what do I see..? 
The love of my life. Belle. A large, white sheep. To make a long story short, I end up making sweet love with that sexy piece of wool till my character passes out from fatigue. 

That can't be right.. I passed out from screwing Belle? How could I do that to her? 
That's when I decided. I needed to hone my abilities, so that I could fuck Belle all night without passing out.
The ultimate quest. The first step was to take a vow of chastity. I sent myself into exile in the Vendigroth Wastes, a place of sand, drought and spiders. Lots of spiders. The poor sods didn't even know what was coming for them.
Blue-balling myself, crushing spiders and demons, praying to Belle every night, caused my necromantic powers to grow. My fatigue had grown exponentially. For months I walked the desert, a robed figure; more dangerous than any creature of the night. My celibacy gave me immense strength. I blew up the heads of my enemies, with my necromantic ""harm""-ability. God, it was like watching Dr. Manhattan blow up gooks in Vietnam. It was time. Time to make my return. But first, I figured I might as well do a part of the main quest, in some nearby mountains. I make my way in. Rats and other pests try to stop me, but I crush them like the vermin they are. Suddenly, an enemy approaches me that I didn't anticipate. An ore golem. He knocks me out and cleaves my skull in. Bah, no worry, I saved my game.. That's when tragedy struck. Through some dark prank by the gods, my hand slipped, and a finger landed on a button on my keyboard. Before I knew what had happened, my save game was deleted. Just as I died. 
My dear Belle, I am watching from heaven, but it is important you move on with your life.

"Que no te engañe las pocas horas que tengo en Steam, hace más de una década jugaba a este juego día si y día también en mi viejo pc con windows 98 pasándomelo en grande con la cantidad de cosas que me ofrecía.

Arcanum es una especie de Fallout 1 steampunk con vista isométrica y con un toque rpg brutal, puedes ser lo que tú quieras: Desde un nigromante que invoca elementales y demonios hasta un ingeniero con arañas mecánicas pasando por un vulgar ladrón, pistolero o un herborista que invoca espiritus del bosque. ¡Incluso puedes hacer una combinación caótica de todas ellas, el juego no te lo va a impedir!

Las opciones y variantes de diálogos que tiene sumado a las skills/perks para la profesión que te de la gana (o la combinación de varias) y el tipo de raza de tu personaje con sus pros y sus contras hace que este juego literalmente se ría de los dos primeros Fallouts. Es un juego bastante desconocido e infravalorado pero si le das una oportunidad su mundo te absorberá enseguida, no hay dos tipos de walkthroughs iguales debido a la cantidad de eventos distintos que se dan y posiblemente acabes en situaciones nuevas.
Hay una grandísima cantidad de ciudades y calabozos que explorar en el mapa, infinidad de tesoros muy interesantes como gemas, armas sagradas o piezas para hacerte tus propios robots.
Sobre los monstruos que puedo decir... Hay prácticamente 300 tipos de enemigos distintos (lobos, zombis, robots, fantasmas, golems y un largo etc...) junto a encuentros aleatorios cuando vas por el mapa, más te vale farmear bien.
En cuanto a la OST solo te puedo decir que si te encantan los violines vas a disfrutarla mucho, a mi particularmente se me hizo muy memorable ;)
Y si, puedes tener followers, una gran cantidad de ellos casi sin limite, algunos se unirán a ti sin dudarlo y otros requerirán algunas condiciones como tener buen karma, los hay que se negarán a unirse a ti porque tienes un follower que les cae mal incluso.

Una buena noticia sobre Arcanum es que es un juego del que no se necesita parches para hacerlo runear correctamente en windows 10 (los hay para mejorar los fps, HD packs y algún que otro para fixear bugs) y ha envejecido bastante bien en comparación con otros juegos de la era prehistórica.

"Arcanum... Ah ! Un vieux jeux parmi tant d'autres, et pourtant qu'il est unique !
Alors commençons par tirer dessus à boulet rouge : il y a des bugs (corrigeables par des patch non-officiel), l'équilibrage des ""classes"" n'est pas équilibré (faire le jeu avec un voleur est... tentable dans le meilleur des cas, le faire avec un bourrin du cac est ennuyeux, le faire avec un personnage charismatique est intéressant, etc), le scénario est parfois obscur et quelques plantages sont à prévoir.
Bon, et bien voilà le maximum de négativité dont je pourrais faire preuve à l'égard du jeu...

Par conséquent, attaquons le plat de résistance et allons vers le positif, ce sera nettement plus copieux.
La création de personnage est intéressante, avec beacuoup de possibilités et énormément de personalisation. Les graphiques sont à l'ancienne, mais c'est fluide (bon, ça rame parfois sur les nouveaux système d'exploitation, mais il suffit de quitter et de relancer le jeu pour que ça aille mieux) et jolie dans l'ensemble. Les musiques sont agréables, parfois stressantes, et les ambiances sonores vraiment sympas et plutôt bien fichues. Le scénario est un peu long à démarer mais... prenant, et avec quelques bonnes surprises.
La cerise sur le gâteau, et ce qui fait d'Arcanum un excellent RPG : cette ambiance, bon sang, MAIS CETTE AMBIANCE ! Simplement magique... Ou technologique selon votre orientation. Le style steampunk est parfaitement réussit et le mélange, parfois le choc, entre les cultures techno-vapeur et magie est particulièrement bien géré. C'est toute sa force, car cela en fait également un univers original. Le fait que le background soit assez bien fournit est égalemnt un plus qui ne fait que renforcer cette ambiance.
A rajouter à cela que le gameplay est complet sans être lourd et que ses aspects sont agréables tout en étant changeants. En effet, passer des schématiques technologiques aux sortilèges en passant par les compétences générales et le social n'est absolument pas rebutant et parfaitement gérable pour n'importe qui, sans pour autant enlver ces choix que l'on devra faire. Car non, on ne pourra pas tout faire et c'est parfait ainsi.
Et par conséquent, la durée de vie du jeu est plutôt bonne ! Refaire le jeu est envisageable sans trop de problèmes car même si le scénario aura son fil conducteur, et bien cela ne se fera pas du tout de la même façon avec un arnaqueur né, un voleur halfelin, un guerrier demi-orque associable, un mage elfe ou un technologiste nain.
Rajoutez à tout cela des modules supplémentaires et vous avez un petit bijoux du début des années 2000.

Alors, il reste ce prix à 10 E sur steam alors que le studio a disparu me direz-vous...
C'est pas faux. Et j'aurai préféré verser cet argent aux développeurs qui ont créer une belle réussite. Malheureusement, Arcanum reste difficile à trouver et à faire fonctionner convenablement sur une machine récente dans les bonnes résolutions. Steam a géré ces deux problèmes. Et puis à titre posthume (ouais, je capilotracte la chose, je sais), continuer de faire vivre Arcanum reste une belle récompence pour ceux qui ont travaillé dessus voici pas loin de vingt ans.

Arcanum vaut vraiment le coup pour les fans de RPG comme d'univers steampunk. Un beau coup de coeur indémodable.",1,1,0,4,0,2018-05-13,2018-05-13,0,55,4897,2122
"Arcanum is my favorite bad game ever. Due to the circumstances around its release, it was never completed. I'll let y'all research that if you're interested. Suffice it to say that the game is pretty broken in some major areas and the combat is absolutely atrocious. Beyond that, it's one of the best, most entertaining, inexhaustible games I've ever played, and it has really shaped my taste in games as an adult.
It isn't a perfect (or even finished) game by any means. But it is the structure of a damn good game, and most of the substance of one, too.",1,1,0,59,0,2018-05-08,2018-05-08,0,2,1456,1083

"This dungeon crawler is interesting. Set in the victorian era, you are still able to choose from the normal races.
Human, gnome, ogre, and elf. Quests are interesting and the gameplay is somewhat akin to baldur's gate.

Movement is either mouseclick or arrow keys. WASD is non existent and as a matter of fact, the S key opens your rest options. If you have trouble with your eyesight, this could prove to be an issue since you can't adjust the display resolution. 
Characters in the game seem to have their own unique personalities so it makes banter somewhat entertaining.

"This is my first time posting a review for a game on Steam.


A well put together combination of D&D with Steampunk.

For 6$ there are HOURS of open world game play and sidequests, several different weapons and crafting schematics, as well as decent mods/patches to choose from.

Too bad there will never be a sequel - it certainly deserves one.

It would give solid 11/10 but sadly only a 9/10 due to intermittent issues running on Windows 10 (even in compatibility mode).

That said, I still believe this is a must play for anyone interested is type of genre.

EDIT/UPDATE: The Steam account/player ELDERKIN has created an awesome disscussion linked here as to a fix for the issues i was having and raised my initial 9/10 to 11/10!

"I remember when I first played Arcanum. A good friend of mine introduced me to the game a ways back. I'd forgotten about it for a while but when it came to a game that had options this was the game I always mentioned and came back to in my memories (though I forgot the name) and now, it's on steam.

Arcanum has a lot going on and can be fairly overwhelming at first look. With some things such as 18+ schools of magic, 8 tech schools, and 4 skill bars along with each one having around 4 to 5 (in the case of the technology skills) skills/tiers each. A morality system and a bar that gauges how inclinded to magic or technology you are? That's a lot. Thankfully the game has built in tool tips to give a bit of information by overing over the stat or bar.

So lets look at some of the game's highlights
1. Choices affect the ending - For those who have played a game like Dragon Age Origins, say is here, your choices through the game no matter how small they may seem, can have a huge impact on the story's ending. 

2. Inventory - Inventory is one you have to think about, in the later Mass Effect game for example, the more weapons you took effected your use of powers/abilities. The same applies, you have a weight limit and like in Diablo and early Fallouts, you have limited inventory space, More weight will mean less actions in battle and it means being less prepared in some cases. You have party members (max 2) who can help carry items, but in all its something to easily lose track of until you get in a pinch.

3. Allies React - This has a few meanings, like if you have a low intellegnce or take a background that makes you seem like an idiot, your allies and the people you meet will react to that, they also react to your moral choices through the game. Do too many evil deeds with a party of noble characters and they'll turn on you, like wise for a party of evil characters and doing too many good deeds, only people I've seen never leave are Virgil (first party member) and the Dog.

4. Magic vs Technology - The game offers a lot in play time, replay ability and just general ways to do things. The big focus though is magic vs technology. If you are too allied with Magic, Tech shops will demand you leave (and sometimes assault you to make you leave) Like wise going tech and into a magic shop, this gets even more complicated when you realize there's 4 potions, 2 tech and 2 magic (your cursor changes to show which type is being used and they are different) use the right tools for the job, don't use Salves (tech potion) on a mage, you might actually use 6-10 before you get a single heal, same with magic healing (potion or spell) on a tech character.

5. Combat - You can change the combat to turn based or free flowing in the options. Personally I like turn based as it gives me time to plan. You have lots of options in combat from spells to melee to inventions and guns. The main things to watch are of course your HP (if allies die, they're dead unless you have a skill/tech that can revive them) and the blue bar, it's not mana, it's Fatigue and if it hit's 0 you faint in battle. This isn't like pokemon where you go back to the inn, it means 100% chance free hits on the character! It can be useful though as weapons have a HP damage and Fatigue damage stat and you can drain your enemies fatigue to give yourself an edge.

6. The world - The map is a very big one, and you have the options of either running place to place the long way or when you reach the boarder of  an area, click the map button (turns to a blue globe) and click points to fast travel. Now obsticles will still be in the way, so if a mountain is in between you and the point you want to go to, you do have to map around it. And it can be a trip, along the way you can be attacked by monsters/wildlife (bears will hate you) and it's not always a cake walk as it can be an enemy you're used to or it could be a horde of bears (had 3 at once before) but there's lots of points to visit on the map and they become active just by passing them. Keep in mind, though you can go to areas such as the final dungeon from the beginning, the game will punish you for it in combat.

7. Character Creation - Probably should have led with this, but oh well. You pick how your character is set up before going on the Zephyr. You pick a portit (that's the easy part), gender, race and background 1st. These all effect how your party memebers and NPCs react to you. Females get races of Human, Elf, Half-Elf, and Half-Orc while males get those, dwarf, halfling and gnome. Each race has unique backgrounds, abilities and reactions and each background effects reactions too. Exaple if you take the Idiot Savant background, you have a huge bonus to your intellgence, a penalty to your strength and everyone talks to you as though you have a intellegnce score of 2 (which leads to some entertaining commentary). After that you get 5 points to level things, you have 8 stats and a ton of formentioned skills. Everything takes only 1 point to level, but is effected by a skill, like to learn Tech tree blue prints you need the matching level of intellegnce(or be really lucky and find the blue print for sale in a store) all magic is learned through the schools here (no buying spells, sorry fellow mages) So planning a bit a head is a good idea, but not manditory. Then you have the option to buy some gear (background effects starting coin) be it some bullets, a gun (you get one fairly early) or just some fair armor/sword to make things a bit easier at the start. 

8. Criticls Effect nearly EVERYTHING! - That's right, from haggling to lockpicking. Shooting to pickpocketing its effected by a crit chance. Some aren't that bad on a failure, like haggling and you might just have to pay a bit higher price, in combat you can kill yourself with a crit fail, lockpicks can jam the door/chest (don't worry you can just break it down/open) But if you don't have the skills, you can ask a party member to do it (or they'll voulenter) for you.

9. Leveling - as you've noticed probably in the pictures, there's 2 red bars in the middle of the screen. Those are your experience bars (yes, bars) The top, thick semented one is your to next level bar, fill it up, you gain a level and a point to invest in a skill/stat. The small thin red bar undereanth it, that's also an experience bar, max it out to gain a portion of the other experience bar. How do you fill that little red one? Do anything but walk and you'll fill it. Make inventions, hit/miss in combat (yeah, hitting yourself with crit failures gives EXP) everything you do will give points to that bar. When you level your HP and Fatigue are restored (you can level mid-combat from crit failing as long as it didn't kill you)

10. One member's trash is another's treasure - There's no real 'vendor trash' items to the game. There's that stuff you'll probably never use like a mage character has no use for old rags or coal. But a tech character can use those things to make explosives and bullets provided you have the recipe. Now you're probably going ""but earlier you said tech merchants won't sell to mages?"" That's true, but there's also general stores who sell the odds and ends of tech inventions like rags and fuel and batteries regardless if you went tech or magic.

Now somethings I'd call 'Cons' to the game (everything else, take it as you like.
These are kinda big now a days. There's no autosave feature. So save often especially in an area you're not famliar with!
The main 'bug' I've found that would be the 2nd ""con"" for me, is you can't tab out. What this means is if you click alt+tab and then go back into the game, it causes a strange graphics glich that will corrupt that game. You can play like that, but it prevents you from saving.

All in all at 6 USD as a base price, this game has a lot to offer besides it's rich story and deep lore.",1,1,0,68,1,2018-04-13,2018-04-13,0,27,236,141

"I have this game on CD and have put in a lot of hours and finished the game years ago.  Nice to see it on Steam.  

It's set in an age with guns, trains, flying machines and recipes for making all manner of technical devices...a more industrial age...but still clings to swords and magic if you're so inclined to go that way.  A very odd mix but either way you choose, it's fun and challenging.  

The story is rich with many twists and turns depending on the dialogue you choose when interacting with others.  Your ability to influence others, including party members, is important as it has the effect on who will deal with you or not or who will party with you or not.   If you're into making your character as good as he can get or as evil then this game is for you.

To players who are used to more modern games be warned this is an older game with dated graphics. (Despite this, the game still runs smoothly}. There is A LOT of traveling between towns and other places just to accomplish one task here and one there.  Seems, at times, there's more traveling from place to place just to advance the game than actual fighting.  There are lots of quests...just about every NPC your character encounter's has a task or three. The world map helps a bit because you can use it to travel to places more quickly.  You will auto-stop to fight if there is a monster encounter along the route.

I recommend this game for an older age group as there are some elements in the game you may not want your younger children playing: i.e., a ""dancing"" parlor with ladies of the evening and sexual innuendo.",1,0,0,2,0,2018-04-08,2018-04-08,0,68,250,225
"This game was great. There was so much to do and it was really well-written. There were so many options for character building and development and there is definitely a ton of replayability.

It took me a little bit to figure out the various menus but I was able to do it without reading the manual. I would recommend this game to any RPG enthusiast and to anyone who may have enjoyed Fallout but also enjoys fantasy/steampunk settings.

Unfortunately, as is, this game has some serious technical issues. It is almost completely unplayable without a fix (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755396888 worked perfectly for me).

Многократно начинал проходить и по-крайней мере 3 раза прошёл Arcanum за многие годы с момента его создания. Но это никак не помешало купить его лицензионную версию и начать проходить его снова! 

""Игра, которую никак нельзя постичь до конца"" - Arcanum не перестаёт меня удивлять снова и снова! Сейчас приведу параллель, мне так легче выражать свои эмоции. Чувство примерно такое: ты всю жизнь прожил на небольшом островке посреди океана и всю жизнь ты был уверен, что исследовав досконально сей островок ты постигнешь весь мир! А потом, забравшись на пальму видишь другие острова - много островов! И осознаёшь, что тебе открыт лишь маленький кусочек этого мира, что целый мир безграничен для исследований! Но жизнь слишком коротка - за неё уж никак не постичь мудрости всех островов!

Но, к счастью, в данном случае речь идёт об игре, которую можно проходить снова и снова, каждый раз развиваясь в совершенно разных направлениях! И каждый раз сталкиваясь с новыми трудностями и задачами!

Поражает тот факт, что в далёком 2001 году мог существовать такой шедевр - сложная, не линейная, с открытым миром, умопомрачительной RPG-системой и замечательной фентези-вселенной! Очень жаль, что в современном игровом мире приветствуется примитивность, линейность и простота - а ведь как чудесно смотрелась бы хардкорная, реиграбельная, с разветвлённым сюжетом (и каждым квестом в т. ч.) и открытым миром совеменная RPG подобного рода, представьте только себе! Но, увы, из современных ""умных"" игр можно выделить лишь ""Ведьмак 3"", но и там, на мой взгляд, слишком уж многое заточено под 12-летнего игрока. 

Стоит заметить, что ""Arcanum"" имеет ряд багов и недочётов интерфейса, которые свойственны играм тех времён. Некоторые из них, к счастью, легко правятся любительскими модификациями.",1,1,0,17,1,2018-01-09,2018-01-09,752,6,14710,2576

"Столкнувшись с Живущим... Ох, то есть, узрев, как Живущий выходит из пламени невредимым, Вирджил подумал, что великий Насреддин мог бы выбрать кого-то поприличнее для собственной реинкарнации. Нет, дева складно говорила и выглядела довольно приятно, но только гадать оставалось, как на борту дирижабля оказалась лохматая замарашка в обносках. Имя у сомнительной леди оказалось самым простым – Энн, и названо оно было так неуверенно, что даже человек гораздо менее проницательный, чем Вирджил, посчитал бы его ненастоящим. Вдобавок – глаза. Точнее, взгляд. Испуганные пассажиры не смотрят с таким восторгом на всепожирающее пламя, едва их не угробившее.

      Впрочем, одна мысль о не слишком удачном выборе Насреддина приравнивалась к богохульству, поэтому Вирджил быстро пресек собственные размышления. Тем более что умытая, причесанная и приодетая Энн уже не казалась такой подозрительной. 

      Ну а когда он прочитал в тарантской газете заметку о таинственном поджигателе – мерзавце и, несомненно, психопате, – скрывшемся от властей... Тогда их уже связывало слишком многое.

      Например, Веллингтон.

      Даже будучи служителем церкви Вирджил понимал, – еще как понимал! – что некоторые люди вполне заслуживают смерти или, как минимум, хорошего удара в челюсть. Например, гнусные шантажисты. Предложить женщине переспать в обмен на какую-то писульку, разрешение пройти в клуб!.. Вирджил не знал, что хуже – этот факт, или тот, что Веллингтон проигнорировал топчущегося рядом Вирджила. Как будто не было никого, способного защитить честь дамы.

      И все-таки, наверное, можно было договориться. Заплатить больше или попробовать пригрозить... Но, говоря честно, Вирджила совсем не возмутило убийство Веллингтона – поделом уроду.

"Arcanum is a classic isometric rpg, that has always been one of those games that I keep coming back to, no matter what, or it's flaws, or glitches, and I always remember it fondly.. It was either a case of too fast too soon on Sierra's part, or simply before it's time, but it never seemed to attain the popularity of other rivalling RPGs had. It's character design, and interesting, slightly dark, slightly humorous tone made for an impressive world.. The gameplay was designed to be very open, allowing you to make a vast array of character concepts, focused on many different roles.

The steampunk setting made for a nice divergence from anything made, and indeed, most games being made currently.. And it's take on magic and machine, having each affect the other, mages found alchemical enhancements and salves failing, while a technophile found themselves resistant to both offensive, and curative magic, felt very grounded and implemented well.

It's a good, if aged game.. If you were ever a fan of games like Fallout, Baldur's Gate, and the like, give arcanum a try.. It take's a little getting used to, but there is fun to be had.",1,1,0,0,0,2017-11-28,2017-11-28,1536,14,25,9

"I have owned the original, classic version of Arcanum for ages, and I am basing this review on this original copy of Arcanum that I owned.

The Fallout series has been known for the multitude of choices and possible play styles, and is iconic as a series where the choices in the game do matter. Even in the later, non-Interplay members of the series, choice is still a strong theme: in Fallout 3, if you did a certain dastardly deed, you can still meet the survivor of one of your deeds, and make some form of amends. With such a strong pedigree to its name, one may wonder if the developers of the original Fallout had applied a similar design approach, but to an entirely different setting, one that would appeal to those who prefer something less dreary than the post-apocalypse. Such a game does exist, that game being Troika’s Arcanum. Troika, which was founded by Tim Cain, one of the lead programmers of Arcanum, made what could be considered to be a fantasy version of Fallout. Except, it is a lot more than that.

Arcanum takes place in a high fantasy Tolkienesque world, that is currently undergoing an Industrial Revolution. Magic and technology are presented as mutually exclusive choices: as magic is a supernatural force, it contravenes natural, and as with it, technological, laws. As such, a mage carrying a gun will have the gun explode in his face, and a machinist trying to use a scroll with experience a similar critical fail. This can be offset, by carefully balancing between both disciplines so that neither aptitude will affect the player character, but this comes at the cost of experiencing the full potential of focusing on either a magic or technological aptitude. But it is this kind of limitation that makes theorycrafting and character-making in the game so incredibly fun. Not to mention, if Fallout allowed the player freedom as to how they wished to play the game, Arcanum takes that freedom and doubles it: there are more options to make a more varied character, more combat options, and even the way combat is conducted can be changed: alternated between classic turn-based, and that real-time that we all know and love.

The game does has one weakness to note. At one early point in the game, there is a very difficult dungeon that every character has to go through. Basic Melee and mage characters can pass through the dungeon with varying levels of difficulty but playthroughs that focus on charisma, persuasion and intelligence, will have to literally cheese through the dungeon, running past all the enemies to reach the end. 

This is, however, only one exception: pass this point, the majority of Arcanum is a game that can be played in a myriad of ways. Want to go full pacifist? Just max out charisma, persuasion and beauty, and focus on diplomacy, and picking the ideal dialogue options, literally avoiding as many fights as possible. Want to play as an inventor with a robot army? Yes that is possible. What about a gentleman mage with a small private army? Also possible. And, to those in the know, you can also play as a corrupt mage that permanently mind controls certain individuals, and amasses a private team of specialized minions to defeat really strong foes.

But that is just gameplay. What about story options? Arcanum is still filled with all kind of choices. You can be the normal goodie two shoes, and do what is right, act like a normal person, ask the right questions, and be hailed as a hero. Or, you  can be a complete sonofabitch, kill your enemies and, loot their personal belongings for clues on where to go next. Or, if you are a dastardly necromancer, you can raise the spirits of the enemies you have slain, and interrogate them for information. Yes, you can do that. You can even follow a completely evil path of the game, follow through on it, and then, halfway through it, decide to go back on the alternate “normal”route - and the game wills till acknowledge that you made both choices.

The game, of course, does have its flaws. It is imperfectly balanced, and, for tech warriors, a certain overpowered weapon can be available to the player far earlier in the game. Additionally, while there are a number of varied technological schematics, and colleges that the player can learn, not all of them will seem relevant to a munchkin playthrough, and thus feel more novel, a challenge for more experienced players to try a playthrough with these weaker colleges. The same applies to magic. And of course, for a game that is now nearly two decades old, it has not been optimized for new computers - certain options have to be undertaken to play the game on modern systems.

But. and for those that can look past the game for its flaws, Arcanum presents a lot of options for the gamer that seeks as much choice as possible. Its world is vibrant and alive, perhaps even more so than Fallout, as it does not exist in the post-apocalypse. Its world, while experiencing an Industrial Revolution, still feels like it is in its prime. The main quest of the game is engaging, and, on top of the main quest, there is a whole bevy of side quests and detours that the player can pursue. The more adventurous can find some really interesting items, including a certain, legendary kungfu throwing weapon. The characters the player can be meet are all varied, even the annoying Virgil, the first character the player encounters. And, assuming one maxes out charisma and persuasion, there is the option to add on fairly incongruous members to the party.

All in all, Arcanum is a forgotten gem. It is sad that Troika did not manage to make the planned sequel to Arcanum that made use of the HL2 engine, but, just as Interplay’s Fallout has been acquired, and revived, by Bethesda, there might be hope that Arcanum could be revived into a sequel. And, even if such a sequel is a complete travesty, the original will always exist, a relic of potential.

EDIT: Having played Arcanum on Gog.com and with a physical version and, those versions of the game require tweaks in order to run it on Windows 10. Booted up my Steam version of Arcanum for the sake of this review, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it starts naturally without any problems.

D'abord on se demande pourquoi seul l'anglais est supporté comme langue alors que le jeu original, sorti depuis pas mal d'années déjà, est paru sous plusieurs versions mais on doit également subir la présence de nombreux bugs qui empêchent de démarrer ou terminer des quêtes ce qui est très frustrant quand on cherche à compléter le jeu dans son ensemble. En outre le jeu a également des problèmes de synchronisation : quand on sait qu'on a joué depuis presque 1 heure mais que votre bibliothèque affiche 1 minute de temps de jeu, ya de quoi se poser des questions sur l'intégrité du jeu en question. Bref, si au départ j'étais ravie de rejouer à ce jeu, après 1 heure d'exploration et de constatation j'en ai finalement été dégouté.

It's not necessarily a gripping story with memorable characters like Baldur's Gate, Fallout or Torment, but the gameplay systems in place, the crafting and exploration/world design make up for it in my opinion.

"This is the best Isometric RPG I have ever played.
It has a massive variety of content and fantastic story, level design, art direction and world building. This game is very dense and feels very real and lived in at times.
The game allows you to choose between Turn Based and Real Time combat, one of which is useful for situations that are moderately difficult and above, and the other is fantastic for when you're level 30 but you decided to do a rat killing quest that you picked up 20 levels earlier. And both options can be exchanged with a simple press of the spacebar.
If you've played Fallout 1 and or 2 and enjoyed it. You absolutely must have this game. It's better than either of those in my opinion. It surpasses Fallout 2 in terms of content, and beats out Fallout 1 in terms of story and writing.
You should definitely get the unofficial patches before playing this game, but once those patches are in then the game is far more stable and smooth than either of the classic Fallouts. I've put about 32 hours into my second character attempt and finally beat the game. I've missed out on a ton of content apparently as I found out from the ending sequence which was akin to the one you get in Fallout where it shows the fate of all the major factions. So there is still plenty for me to revisit and discover on a second full play through.
The sheer amount of skills and professions and schools of magic alone makes the game worth playing. It's all very well thought out and works wonderfully together. I was amazed from begining to end. I'm hoping they will never make a sequel or that no one *cough* BETHESDA *cough* will ever try to ruin this games world with a soulless cashin like they did with the Fallout series.",1,1,0,44,0,2017-09-29,2017-09-29,0,59,6234,2748

"Arcanum is a classic RPG in vein of Fallout or Dragon Age. You have a single character and some other characters join you. It looks like open world game but there aren't so many locations and dungeons, but each one unique and covered with some sort of quest. There are lot of those and they usually have varying outcomes.

The game has a very unique world, the main theme is industrial revolution happening in a typical fantasy world. There are many ways to develop your character but if you chose magic or technology then you'll have to go all the way for the best effect. There are lots of dialogue in the game and it's often important, only few characters have voice over. The best thing about this game is music and atmosphere: it's a really appealing take on Victorian fantasy. Novel-like dialogue adds to it.

Sadly the combat in this game isn't very good. You can switch between turn-based and real-time combat. The good idea would be to use turn-based combat in serious battles, you should also raise your main combat skill early to not have constant critical misses. The game allows for a lots of freedom - classic ""kill everyone"" challenge is certainly possible, as well as being pacifist, or never use magic and so on.

This game has dwarves with guns, elves with necromancy, half-orcs being exploited as a cheap labour in factories, human entrepreneurs changing the economy of the world, archaeologists excavating remains of dragons, greedy gnomes conspiring in their secret societies. It also has the best city in any RPG - Tarant. It's huge, interconnected and believable. Sadly the game may feature too little reactivity and depth for modern standards - while some NPCs go home to sleep most just stand there. Certain playstyles are much better than others: traditional melee fighters is better than anyone, guns are underpowered, mages are only great in late game, throwing is useless. It's an old school RPG system where the game allows you to create any character you want but the world has very specific challenges; being a great gambler would help you in a couple of quests and will solve your money problem but it's more of a self-imposed challenge to learn Gamble instead of fighting skills. Still the game is not that hard and you can get several companions so you can complete the game as any type of character.

I recommend using Multiverse Edition to get widescreen and some fixes. Don't get too greedy with the resolution, everything will be too small if you try more than 1600x900.

"This is a wonderful game that was overlooked when released and fell into the dustbin of gaming history.

First off you create your character with all sorts of ""perks"" and backgrounds which are quite humorous. Just putting together your character is loads of fun. 

The world you visit is very intersting and quite large, like the JRPG's of that time aka Final Fantasy. The combat system is sort-of DND, turn based, with magical vs technological weapons & the writing is decent in a sort of tongue-and-cheek play on Victorian England. You also get to make various choices which will affect the world, summed up in a final epilogue after you defeat the big bad guy. 

I haven't had any issues with the game apart from the native resolution which either runs in a window or is haphazardly stretched to fit my 21:9 monitor. So if you have an ultrawide that is one thing to consider.

If you liked older RPGs such as Septerra Core and Baldur's Gate you will probably like this too.",1,1,0,20,0,2017-09-01,2017-09-01,0,19,262,218

"My favourite videogame, absolutely recommended.  

- Wonderfully written dialogues
- A coherent and deep as hell ecosystem of phylosophical positions, cultures, social dynamics, history...
- Potentially an infinite replayabiity thanks to the combinatory system of skills, race, gender, background history...
- Decisions actually causes entertaining consequencies, thousands of decisions
- Vast explorable open-world
- Film, books and every kind of cultural referencies hidden here and there
- Beautifully modeled isometric steampunk artworks
- The soundtrack. Man,  Ben Houge made a pure masterpiece. 

Plus, it's one of the most complex and original storyline eva made, keep your the witcher 3 and it's  photorealistic repetitive questlines hahaha

 Jokes apart, it's a classic piece for nostalgic buddies like me, and in order to be appreciated requires some patience and forgiveness because from the gameplay experience /  graphic point of view it's a sweet poor 2001 grandma. Not pure adrenaline, but slowly appreciable.

 I still love it after all these years and bought it again to feel nostalgic and say thanks to the developers.  (It required a DOUBLE CD version at the timeto install and play haha)

Now the tweaks.
On windows 10 you may need to make some adjustments to play it properly but after that it will works fine also in 4K:
Just download the ""arcanum unofficial patch"" (google it or here is the link https://terra-arcanum.com/drog/uap.html) It solves every compatibility issues and adds many cool features!

If that doesn't work just try this old workaround:

if you go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arcanum You'll find a file called ""SierraLauncher.ini"" 
Open it as a text file and replace it with this:

[Launcher]
Name=Arcanum
NumButtons=1
GameManual=Manual.pdf

Game1Name=Game
Game1Prog=other
Game1Path=Arcanum\
Game1Exe=Arcanum.exe
Game1Cmd= -no3d -doublebuffer


Actually you modify two options in the Game1Cmd part: you activate ""no3d"" and ""doublebuffer"" options. 

Someone also suggests to delete the ""ddraw.dll"" file located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arcanum\Arcanum, and replace it with 
another one that you can easily find online, plus a file called ""wined3d.dll.

Online you can also find a level Cap remover (maximum level otherwise is 50)
and some resolution modifiers to play it on 16/9 res.

If you can get past the technical issues, the game itself is very good. Arcanum is a large world with plenty to do. There is quite a lot of options in character customization and many companion characters that you can get to join your party in your travels. One of the best things about this game is the dialogue.

"Арканум - справжня рольова гра, яка нажаль не отримала тієї слави і відомості, яку мала б. Як би це не звучало дивно, у більшості рпг, як старих так і практично у всіх сучасних, рольовий елемент майже відсутній. В Арканумі раса і стать ДІЙСНО впливає на проходження. Так, наприклад, в NWN2 всім пофіг, що ви тіфлінг або якийсь там дроу, хоча нпс мали б відноситись з підозрою, а в Pillars of Eternity, граючи за смертельного богоподібного, на мою расову принадлежність зреагувало лише один чи два нпс, при цьому на проходження квесту це ніяк не вплинуло (якщо я помиляюсь, наведіть приклади в коментраріях під рецензією), хоча за лором всі мають шугатися такої персони. Тому ви можете грати за злого чарівника, який продав душу дияволу, божевільного технаря, що ставив на собі експерименти, сцикливого дрища, або мегатупого здоровяка-дуболома і кожне проходження буде різним, та і якого персонажа ви не створили б, гру пройти буде можливо. Ох, а цей чудовий стімпанковий світ, в якому просто розчиняєшся... Звісно у Арканума є немало мінусів: великий, але пустий світ, ультра-імбовість технології в другу половну гри, неілюзорно тупий штучний інтелект, баги, а також відсутність душевних діалогів зі супутниками. Арканум - це вічна класика, гра, подібної до якої, скоріше за все, вже ніколи нічого не буде. Арканум - це один з стовпів істинних рпг.

"""I'm steampunk now.""- Jordan Peele, after playing this game

Pros:
+ Characters, quests, and the setting in general are engaging and well thought-out.
+ [spoiler]The interplay between magic and technology[/spoiler] is integrated into the mechanics in an enjoyable way.
+ Unlike other CRPGs made by this dev team, different character builds (technology, magic, stealth, gunplay, etc.) are pretty well-balanced; a [i]lot[/i] of different approaches are viable.
+ Any RPG that lets you play a dwarf gets points in my book.
+ Exploration is rewarded; besides barrels of loot, exploring that little side path will often lead you to an interesting sidequest.
+ This game does a better job than some others I've played of keeping track of quests and rumors.
+ Theoretically, local co-op is possible via LAN, if you can get together a bunch of nerds who would rather set up a switch than just play some shitty steampunk homebrew on roll20.

Cons:
- Windows 10 no longer directly supports the type of graphics card this game was built for; consequently, it lags a lot for a game that, on paper, should be about as resource intensive as a powerpoint slideshow. 
- The steam download doesn't include the world editor, which is pretty much the main draw of multiplayer. 
- The auto level-up mechanic is the real hard mode, because it'll blow your points on useless health and fatigue upgrades.",1,1,0,11,1,2017-07-27,2017-07-27,0,6,1763,888
"Garbage...utter crap.

I wanted to like this game. It sounded intriguing. Player reviews ramped it up. So I buy it, start it. My sad, 84 minute epic is as follows:

-Ship crashes
-Search wreckage for items
-Meet dude who will most likely be my lead into the story
-Explore, get attacked by wolves (or something similar)
-Try to fight back. Attacks NEVER hit, not even once.
-Get dead, try over...multiple times
-Then, main quest dude gets killed, and I get killed again, because I can't HIT ANYTHING.
Get fed up with crap game, chalk it up to a complete waste of time, uninstall, and move along, thankful that I only paid a meager sum for this piece of crap.

Now I get that I probably did something wrong in building my character. But if that's the case, then the damn game is too limited in scope if it's forcing me to build a certain way to play the game. It sounds like it has a great story, but sadly I'll have to pass, because that shit beginning has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I just can't be bothered with it anymore.

Arcanum is a really old-school game from a time where walkthroughs weren't readily available as it is now, but ive tried playing the game without it and found out that i love it.

It has some resemblence of diablo like game, but it has more like a Dungeon and Dragons kind of wibe when it comes to combat, where everything has a ""chance"" to happen. Like everything from healing to hitting your opponent or the gun you're using exploding in your hand.

This game doesn't hold your hand, you have to figure out everything on your own, which i love about this game. There is alot of try, die, try and survive aspects, so you have to save everytime you are going to  do something at all.

From what i've played i would highly recommend this game from a modern gamer standpoint. Even tho i did start with old-school games like this one, i didn't really ""understand"" games until i grew older.

"С Арканумом я познакомилась несколько лет назад и была поражена тем, что настолько проработанную игру смогли создать ещё в 2001. Полностью открытый мир, огромное количество секретов и побочных заданий и просто невероятная вариативность - серьёзно, здесь можно сделать всё, что захочется. Можно убить любого персонажа и забрать его имущество или, напротив, стать обаятельнейшим мастером убеждения и пройти игру пацифистом; можно быть волком-одиночкой или собрать компанию на семь ""человек"" 
(в кавычках - ибо далеко не все из них люди); можно спасти и приручить собаку; можно принять квест на поиск какого-то мощного предмета, а в результате оставить его себе; можно создать персонажа полным идиотом и всю игру ловить фан с его тупых реплик, таких же тупых записей в журнале и реакции на него окружающих; можно собирать роботов, которые будут драться на вашей стороне; можно воскрешать мёртвых, призывать их дух с того света или поднимать трупы; наконец, можно присоединиться к силам зла, в результате чего вам откроется совершенно новая ветка...

Но я отвлекаюсь. Мир Арканума - довольно необычный стимпанк, в котором сосуществуют магия и технология. Соответственно, вам придётся сделать выбор между тем и другим... или не делать и просто выносить всех в рукопашном бою; в любом случае, что бы вы ни выбрали, навыков для изучения будет более чем достаточно. Как и всегда в РПГ такого масштаба, основной сюжет немного на заднем плане, но он есть, и хороший; кроме того, здесь очень атмосферная музыка, исполняемая исключительно на струнных. Пожалуй, единственное, в чём игру можно упрекнуть - не самая симпатичная графика, однако, я считаю, ради всего остального с ней можно смириться.

До Арканума из РПГ я играла лишь в Dragon Age: Origins, но игра всё равно принесла мне море удовольствия. До сих помню, как я радовалась, когда наконец смогла найти броню на сопартийца-орка, которому почти ничего не подходило и который до этого кучу времени бегал голышом; как совершенно случайно наткнулась на редчайшее платье, улучшающее отношение всех НПС к вам и по дурости пропущенное мной в самом начале; как украла оптическую винтовку - лучшее огнестрельное оружие в игре... Арканум дарит множество таких моментов. Это просто шикарная игра, один из эталонов жанра, и я всем советую её опробовать.",1,1,0,63,2,2017-07-02,2017-07-03,322,27,1713,1643

"Well, I know this is gonna garner hate, but it's about time I said something.

Older games like Arcanum may be lauded as underrated forgotten classics, which it may well be, but I don't think I'll ever find out personally. The reason for this is that the simple acting of moving, looting, and doing basic rpg things in this game are a pain in the ass.

This along with System Shock 2 are the few games under my ""i believe you when you tell me it's a classic"", but I'll never finish it category. For having the basic sin of be almost anti-player friendly. In fallout you can move across a map quickly and easily, even in Baldur's gate gate and IWD with a party of six, you can manage without much trouble. In Arcanum just looting around the airship is a lesson in tedium.

So, that's about it. There's a reasons some forgotten classics remained that way, like a really pretty dress from 1925 with awkward zippers that like two people know how to correctly fit into.",0,1,0,28,2,2017-06-21,2017-06-21,225,114,100,99

"Update! 2/3/19 - If you install the unofficial patch and the high res patch, then open the .exe in windowed mode (as administrator) it seems to run smoothly. This amazing game was previously unplayable in fullscreen but works like a charm in windowed mode. It's a shame this game has been long abandoned because a hotfix to make it run in a windowed mode (or better yet full screen windowed mode) would be amazing for this. It takes some effort to set up, but if it is worth it if you do!

I will keep my post negative because it seems to be helpful, but I completely endorse this game with the aforementioned fix to optimize it.

Original post:
While the gameplay is pretty fantastic it simply is not designed to run on Windows 10. I've spent a lot of time trying to optimize the game but after a few minutes it will almost definitely slow down on you to the point where it is unplayable. Every few minutes will require a fresh restart.

It cannot be run in a high priority mode without destroying the graphics. I even tried setting up short cuts to run it in on high with no luck. It uses an ancient version of direct X that simply doesn't work as well on Windows as you'd expect.

The only issues I had were of the technical nature, it being an old game. It runs okay, sometimes it slows down a bit. When I downloaded a widescreen high res patch it slowed down a lot, but there is a good looking steam guide on how to speed up the game running slow on modern machines that I will try. Save early and often and you should be fine.

Also the save game files are stored in the game's directory folder, not Documents like new games are, so if you reinstall Windows make sure you backup the right folder -- I learned this the hard way but only about 5 hours in thankfully.",1,0,0,6,0,2017-05-22,2020-09-29,0,20,4578,1119

"Super crpg dans la veine des anciens baldur's gate et fallout qui étrangement reste assez méconnu, grand fan du genre je l'ai moi même découvert longtemps aprés sa sortie mais j'ai largement rattrapé mon retard depuis.
J'ai par exemple incarné : 
- un demi-ogre autiste versé dans les arcanes,
                                           - une elfe raciste amatrice de technologies,
                                           - un gnome charismatique accompagné d'une ribambelle de compagnons,
                                           - une humaine vouée au mal ayant pactisé avec un démon...

Bref je pourrais continuer longtemps comme ça tant la création de perso est unique en son genre, avec un système sans classe à la fallout. Le scénar et les combats (au tour par tour ou temps réel, au choix sur une simple touche) se défendent trés bien aussi.
L'univers est plutôt original, avec d'un côté la fantasy habituelle  et d'un autre côté une technologie émergente qui vient bousculer un monde habitué à la magie. 
Voilà super jeu donc que je conseille plus que vivement !

Cette version steam par contre ne propose que l'anglais alors que le jeu existe bel et bien en français, voix et textes. 
J'ai rapidement réussi à mettre les textes en fr en suivant la même méthode que pour la version gog mais hélas sans les voix et il reste quelques résidus d'anglais dans les menus et certains dialogues.

- Из-за сроков ее пришлось выпустить раньше времени. В игре было много багов и недоделанный баланс.

"It's easy to state if a game is terrible, bad, decent, good, or outright genius - much of this will be depending on the opinion of the player on certain types of games.

Let's instead state the issues the game has - and in particular, after you also install the bug-fitched patch.

List of issues:
1: Beauty stat is almost useless. In a game where a lot of possibilities exist, this one could have somehow been given a little more importance, or otherwise at least some extra gameplay options (quests that require high beauty for example).
2: Some spells will pretty much never be used, and are pointless to learn, aside from sometimes you needing them to reach higher in a school of magic.
3: Most follower characters are not voiced - a few key ones are, furtinately - but it could have been easy to have added this for the other roughly 15-20 followers that are now left voiceless.

Yeah... that's pretty much it.

Greatest things on this game though, and I think anyone would agree there:

1: Storyline is awesome, with lots of pun in it too (Gilbert Bates and his competitor who will never invent anything decent, Cedric Appleby both stand out for just char names alone).
2: This game has one of the best and most difficult side-quests of any game ever (Gods quest, or blessing from the gods quest... just try doing this one without looking up online how exactly to do it... will take you ages to figure out and then it STILL would be worth it :))
3: The ""discrimination"" of races in between eachother is a genius move on how it was implemented.


It's one of my favorite games from years and years ago, and Im happy to see it on Steam. Added it simply because of nostalgia, but this game is more than just that - it really is one of the best games in its genre of all time.

I invite anyone to try it if they have never done so - do install the patch, but don't read up on anything else about it online that provides spoilers about the story or about the quests... let it be as interesting to you as it can possibly be.",1,1,0,6,0,2017-04-17,2017-04-17,0,3,2038,398

"Meine erste Review also bitte etwas nachsicht :p

Arcanum habe ich anno dazemal durch zufall in einer ausgabe der pc games käuflich erworben und war, nach kurzer skepsis sehr angetan. die grafik ist vieleicht nicht jeder man seins aber lässt man sich auf das ""abenteuer"" zwischen Technik und Magie ein, findet man sich sehr schnell in einer welt wieder, in der ein ständiger konflikt tobt in diesen ihr als protagonist aktiv eingreifen könnt!

Die auswahl an optionen mit der ihr euren Charakter erschaffen könnt und die möglichkeiten diesen weiter auszubauen sind, auch wenn es vllt etwas übertrieben klingt, weg weisend und beeinflussen mit jedem gesetzten skillpunkt die spielwelt um euch herum.

Es fängt nicht nur an der Wahl der Rasse und des Geschlechts an, auch bei den klassischen atributten wie intelligenz, stärke etc, aber auch die etwas ausergewöhnlichen attribute Schönheit die neben Charisma einen einfluss hat, zum beispiel wie die npc´s auf euch reagieren.
Neben den oben genannten kann man sich, dies ist optional, eine hintergrund geschichte für seinen ""avatar"" aussuchen die durch zum teil ihrer starken boni auch sehr auf die spielwelt einfluss haben.

Die story ist genauso packend wie früher , sofern man sich darauf einlässt.

Die Comunity an sich ist recht überschaubar aber ist sehr stark in den bereichen grafik, bug und crashfixing beteiligt.

das einzige manko an der version die über steam zu erhalten ist, das sie nur auf englisch zur verfügung steht.
aber dank der starken comunity ist das auch kein problem und waren seid dem release auf steam fleisig und haben stehts ihren ""deutschpatch"" bearbeitet und somit ist dies auch kein problem das spiel auf deutsch zu spielen.
was sehr gut ist, da die original vertonung, die stimmen etc nicht so gut und stimmig sind wie die deutsche vertonung.

kurz gesagt: ein sehr gutes spiel das durch story und tiefe überzeugt aber schwächen in dem bereich grafik und benutzer content bietet.

"Warning: This game needs an unofficial patch and numerous Windows compatibility tweaks to work.  Nothing too intensive, but it's worth it because the end result is magnificent.  Arcanum is a huge open world fantasy and ""steampunk"" RPG, made by the same brilliant minds who brought us Fallout and Fallout 2.  The amount of role-playing is even comparable to Fallout 2, which has the most of any video game.  

Play as a Human, Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, Orc, Half-Orc, Half-Ogre, Gnome, or Halfling.  Use the wonderful classless stat/rule system to build a unique character, defining eight different physical and mental attributes, and choosing either magic or technology or even both (although balance is really geared toward just one or the other). Or perhaps neither? Focus on several different magic schools, or become an expert fighter and maybe smith, or a master archer, or a gunslinger, or an alchemist, or a bomb maker, or a chemical weapons genius, or an electrical or mechanical wizard, or a thief, the choice is yours.

If your Intelligence is too low, you won't be able to speak properly (the entire game is rewritten), people will look down on you and not give you the same opportunities they would a normal person, and you won't ever have any spellcasting ability or technological mastery.  

This game features 16 spell colleges and 5 spells in each for a total of 80 spells, as well as 8 technological disciplines and 7 degrees (each bringing a unique recipe) for each.  4 combat skills, 4 thieving skills, 4 social skills, 4 tech skills.  

A very in-depth, full fledged RPG with a massive 190 page manual.  The rule system is so good, so complete that it seems like it stems from a pen and paper RPG but it doesn't. The same applies to Fallout, these developers (formerly Interplay/Black Isle Studios, before Troika) were just the best at making video game RPGs.

The world building is also so well written that one wouldn't think it is an original video game universe, but it is.  So much detail packed into every town and city, every culture, and all of it is explored better than today's RPGs even dream of (they lack the ambition).  This is a story driven RPG, and the story is intriguing from the start.  It is a story wrapped in thematic material with some social commentary, carefully examining and showing us the dangers and benefits of technological revolution from multiple perspectives.  Characters are written with greater attention to detail than most games by far, although it is not at the very top tier in this regard either.

Arcanum has some of the most brilliant quest design you will find in any RPG.  Again, the level of artistic vision and creativity it exhibits in this regard is not seen in modern RPGs.  No hand holding, your journal (quest log section that is) is written from the perspective of the character, not a narrator or godlike figure.  It doesn't tell you more than you can possibly know, so it tells you what to do but not exactly how to do it.  And if your intelligence is too low, your journal/log will show it.

My favorite example of this is the quest called ""Horror Among the Dark Elves"" which is an authentic Lovecraftian short story.  As a fan of Lovecraft, the presence of such a quest took me utterly by surprise.  It begins with a book which you find in the game, a book detailing an investigation into disturbing events, gradually becoming more unnerving as you read it.  To continue the quest, you must follow up on leads mentioned in the book; the game doesn't explicitly tell you this, you must use your own common sense and intuition which is now a forbidden approach to mainstream game design.  Some of those leads are names of people, places, and more.  You can ask around, ask people who might have more knowledge than common civilians like the authorities or innkeepers.  Better yet, check the Hall of Records in Tarant.  The point is, you conduct your own logical, authentic investigation into matters, rather than just following an objective marker to a location and killing everything there.  Quest design in Arcanum involves more than just combat, and more than just dialogue too, and they are rewarding for what they add to the story thematically.

Not every quest is excellent of course.  Some side quests involve overly helpless and brainless characters, like most other games and movies.  But the amount of great quests outweighs the amount of generic ones by far.

Arcanum lets you choose real time or turn-based combat.  Since it is an isometric 2.5D game, turn-based is the best choice I think, it lacks the fluidity and precision for real-time.  The camera can interfere with combat at times, all the more reason to go with turn-based.  Combat can range from typical sword and shield or axe and shield melee battles, or twin daggers with stealth, or large two handed melee weapons, to flintlock pistols, revolvers, repeating rifles, even a flamethrower and grenade launcher, to wild technological gizmos like electric staves and clockwork spiders and so much more.  Then there are the 80 spells of course, few of them being useless.  The use of stealth in combat can be greatly improved however, D&D video games do this much better.

You can actually kill anyone and everyone in the game, at will, and it has massive consequences for such. And you can revive them with necromancy.  You may have noticed that much of what I said; the racial variety and the open world free roaming, resembles The Elder Scrolls to some extent.  But unlike The Elder Scrolls, Arcanum has role-playing depth.  It actually REACTS to what you do in realistic ways, it reacts to your character build.  You will encounter racism or favoritism.  If you are a technological expert, you will come into conflict with mages, and vice versa.  So many different ways this game responds, so much dialogue variety, they do not make such great RPGs anymore sadly.

The last portion of the game, after the point of no return, is a disappointment.  This includes the ending.  Troika built up such a grand tale to the point where they were not able to write a satisfying conclusion in the time they were given.  But that's only the last hour of the game or so, at least.  And since people love it so much, any significant action you commit (ones that affect communities but many others) anywhere throughout the game provides a unique ending slide.

For the maximum UK experience, play this game and also watch Barry Lyndon.",1,1,0,45,0,2017-04-10,2020-09-05,0,163,93,18
"How unfortunate this game wasn't optimized for better gameplay.

While sure it was buggy, there were so many different things you could do on your adventure that rolling a new character was almost more fun than actually reaching the end with one.

Running with a gaming laptop (GTX1060 and 32gb ram), the game is chopping, lagging, there is no decent point of framerates that don't jump around or get stuck randomly, and it looks ridiculous in its resolution versus my monitor's. This is still a great game, I just wish I had a slower computer to play it on so that it runs the way it did way back in the day.

Oh well, still felt like I had to buy it again, because it was such a great in its day.",1,1,0,1,0,2017-04-08,2017-04-08,323,56,59,18

"I love this game. This game is worth your time if you like good writing, a well-developed world, and interesting characters.

But I'm going to preface this review with a caveat: You absolutely NEED to install unofficial patches and content to make this a worthwhile game. Troika Games was known for their expansive, well-written games, but eventually went out of business because they were so buggy. You need unofficial patches and mods to make this game the game it could be.

When you do install those? It's a narrative experience like no other. The combat leaves much to be desired, but that's not why you should be playing. You should be playing for the truly open-world experience and clever, interesting dialog.

You will never see everything in this game. It's just not possible without hundreds upon hundreds of hours. But it is worth your time. Play it, please. You won't regret it.",1,0,0,1,0,2017-03-19,2017-03-19,0,5,14,14

Arcanum represents a role-playing game (RPG) developed by the company Troika Games and published by the company Activision. Troika Games is also responsible for the creation of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. 

[i] Pro & contra: [/i]

+ Creative concept of a RPG world where followers of magic or technology are fighting against each other for supremacy. It tends to encourage spontaneous role-playing by providing entertaining dialogue options, depending on the race and character statistics, e.g. amount of followers is limited by charisma.

+ Well done manual gives insights regarding gameplay mechanics, and supports immersion into the world of Arcanum.   

o Community patch is recommended, in order to fix some bugs that are not covered by the last official patch. Furthermore, there are some useful Steam guides improving the gameplay, e.g. preventing the occasional slowdowns in cities.

- Without additional patching and customization some gameplay aspects will be rather frustrating. Lack of Interaction between the members of the group. Musical background and sounds are repetitive.

[i] Summary: [/i]

Arcanum has a good and solid gameplay that is held back from being great by various issues. It is directed at old school gamers, who prefer text-based RPGs and are willing to tweak the game with different fan-made patches.  

Recommended for hardcore RPG players.

"TL:DR 

Haters gonna hate becuase it's old and they lack the brain power to comprehend the games greatness. People that love it have a history with it. These people see the games potential for a sequal or remastered/remake of the game (with modder support). You will love it if you like games like balder's gate.


So I personally Love this game. It has a spot near and dear to my heart. One of the things I tell gamers about myself, when that topic comes along, is Arcanum is one of the greatest games I ever played. Now when you look for the negative reviews on this game you'll find people whining about graphics and it doesn't work. Yeah, game is a bit dated and I say A BIT dated. Though if you can get over that you will find a gem tucked away under years of other old games that were forgotten. I loved this game back in the day becuase it was a game that introduced to AI teammates that would question me for killing a shopkeep becuase that sweet sword he has is 1238 coins more than what I have in my coin purse at the moment. I loved the way I could walk from one destination of the map through the unknown and discover literally the unknown. When I say unknown maybe I should say the long forgotten. HMMMMM! Yes! Mystery.... Places like caves, alters.... and portals to hell itself. I also loved the lore that you discover from all the quests and books (if you don't like reading it's ok. I don't like it eaither. which is why I put the TL:DR.)  I especially love it when I come across a quest about some monster in the woods that always attacks children. ""Oh really, you don't say."" (opens a book I have read before that mentions a monster that lures kids into the forest.) ""Oh sh*t! This is it!"" My MOST FAORITE PART is relations and relationships. You can get into them with certain characters. I was roughly thirteen when I first laid hands on this game. That faid to black scene was the greatest moment of my young life. So unexpected. Anyways.... Now though, my love for the game is the history we had together and the love for the Idea of what it could be. Yeah some modders got together in the ealy 2000s to mod it. But really those mods all just scratch the potential for what Arcanum could really be if it was remaid or continued through a sequal. Anywyas, nostalgia and the idea of a future for it 10/10. Give her a go and you might find adventure!!!! (fade to black)",1,1,0,0,2,2017-02-27,2017-02-27,0,2,3206,23
"/TLDR: So is Arcanum a good game? No absolutely not! The gameplay is mostly dusty and old and had a lot of faults even when it came out, BUT: If you can overlook such faults or live with them about 40-100 hours then you can experience a very special handcrafted high-fantasy/steampunk-World with an elaborately told story!
But should you?
Short answer is: No, unless you are an avid reader and the story and atmosphere is atleast two to four times more important to you than gameplay, graphics and a bugfree experience. This game is really just for hardcore classic-isometric-rpg-gamefans(from the 90ties) or bookworms with thick nerves.

Still a better ending than Mass Effect 3! :TLDR/

The game takes itself pretty serious but if you really delve into it you see the budget constraints in every corner, even in areas of story and atmosphere.
-most companions aren't really fleshed out and only a couple have a quest according to them which you could miss doing because you didn't know you had to take that special char with you(but it gives you a reason to play it again, which you shouldn't).
-most subquests are pretty well written but rather short. There are only a handful that take you to more than 1 or 2 locations aside from the mainquestline(which is pretty good).
+The newspaper system is pretty unique and surprisingly well integrated in the game! Why don't we have this in other titles as well?!?
+The writing is superb in almost all aspects! The best part is that even your journal depends on the type of character you have, as in dumb or inteligent).
-The journal and interface are pretty but not handy, there are not enough shortkeys to actions, the journal is a mess to handle and without a manual you can't even look it up on the pc because alt-tabbing doesn't work with the graphicsengine.
-The combat is a joke and either unbeatable or hilariously easy if you don't mind that many companions die in many situations because there is no NPC-AI that works in this game, just play on easy. Even Baldur's Gate had a better combat system(which was horrible).
+Character creation is for one very easy and also very versatile(without a good avatar-customization).
+Choices are mostly open and great incorporated and there are many secrets to uncover, but sadly you are discouraged because of the gameplay.

Protips: 
-Install the Unofficial Patch
-Install the Levelcap remover(don't forget to move a file to arcanums folder, or you get a crash every time you reach level 50/51)
-don't alt-tab or try using windowed mode
-Learn Teleport even if you're a Technofan
-Save alot and look up a guide after you have done a quest to find out if you missed something important which could brake another quest or if you didn't like your choice.
-All Inns have safecontainers afaik. Inventory is a hassle.

"I used to play this a long time ago when it came out on CD-ROM. It's a fantastic game with a unique setting. It has a complex and in-depth story. Its style can easily be compared to the original 2 Fallouts or Baldur's Gate. Lots of choices, lots of different paths to take and lots of way to get yourself into trouble as well. Save often, and having multiple save files is not a bad idea because if things go south on you the game can be a bit unforgiving but it's still a blast to play. 

The character development has tons of different options from how you initially create your character and how you choose to develop them as the game progresses. You will need to make a choice between being technology or magic oriented. It is possible to try a combo of the two, but I never had a ton of success with that others may be able to tell you better formulas for combining them.

Bottom line: If you enjoyed the original Baldur's Gate and/or the original 2 Fallouts, there is a good chance you will like this. It runs in the same 3rd person style RPG and you pick up party members along the way. Just keep in mind that it is not the type of game you want to rush through as making fast, rash decisions can get you into trouble if you choose poorly; besides, there is so much in the game to explore. I definitely recommend this if you have an affinity for the older generation games and the good old days when graphics weren't everything and they could compensate for the graphics with amazing content and story!",1,1,0,7,0,2017-02-01,2017-02-01,0,1,104,26

"This game is nearly 20 years old, and I was really happy with the complexity and depth of the gameplay.

I added three basic mods before I played this game. If you're thinking that it's a huge pain in the butt to figure out mods, don't worry, the ones for this game are pretty clear-cut and easily installed. 

cRPGs were not my cup of tea until recently. I actively avoided isometric games. I love reading, though, and I've been hooked by a few smaller games whose communities strongly suggested Arcanum.

"[b]NOTE:[/b] I recommend downloading the fan patch and playing the game using turn-based combat for the best experience. 

Arcanum has incredibly reactive world, where technology and magic oppose each other. It features a great character creation system, and progression system. You are not locked into a role, but put your points towards skills and attributes you want to increase such as Firearms, Melee, Speech, Dexterity, etc. Not only might decisions during character creation differ how you play, it will change how you are treated by the world. 

Play a mage? Well, now you can no longer ride the train and you will have difficulty healing more technology-inclined party members. 
Play a low-intelligence character? Everyone will treat you like an idiot, and you will be granted some amusing dialogue and journal updates. 
Play a highly charismatic character? Avoid combat encounters, or if enganged in combat, have your army of followers murder everything as they'll all love you!

You won't be able to experience everything in one playthrough as quests (and their solutions) and followers, among other things, can differ due to your decisions, which is one of the great things about the game. You play a role, and in that role, it has consequences which shape the experience of your playthrough. This allows for a great amount of replayability.

This also enhances the questing experience. While a technological inclined individual might need to follow the footsteps of a murder mystery, if you're a necromancer...just summon his spirit and ask him! The game encourages you to search for possible alternate solutions.

Arcanum also features a soundtrack that is only a string quartet, and it is magnificent. Very melancholic and enhances the adventure.

I personally enjoyed the combat, but there are times where some dungeons drag on and overstay there welcome turning it into a slog. Also, the game has some balancing issues where some builds are flat out superior. 

Overall, I highly recommend Arcanum. It really is truely a unique experience and probably my favorite RPG ever.",1,1,0,2,0,2017-01-25,2018-06-06,0,58,15215,14360
"This gem is too much underrated. I've never seen game with such great storytelling and atmosphere.
And as a bonus you have steampunk setting which is so rare. Yes, there are games out there with bits and pieces of ""steampunkish"" visuals. But what other game throws you into the middle of industrial revolution, with quest directly touching the question of coexistence of nature and technology?
Arcanum doesn't limit your path choices in any way. Yo can play mage (destroying enemies with sole sight, traveling among flock of familiars), gun wielding technologist (in steampowered armor with mechanical companions) or anything between. What else do you need.
In character creation you can choose from half-dozen races with tens of different backgrounds which are often mutually exclusive and can completely change the way you experience this wast world.
So why is this game pretty much forgotten? Answer may be hidden in problems it has.
Levels gaining is unbalanced. Depending on your carrier choice you can rocket to the level cap long before half of game or struggle to gain much needed skills.
Related problem is leveling of followers, they doesn't get any experience but level up with PC. If you recruit them too late, they have no chance to reach level cap. That wouldn't be problem, if you had control over their skill distribution - but alas, you don't. This underlines the lack of control over them which is painfully evident especially in combat.
Another big problem may lay in confusing quests. You often can't say what approach is right. Rude answer in one dialog will lead only to escalation to violence, another time it is only way to access much needed options. Only way to find out is Save&Load which somebody may find frustrating. And there are few quest which end without any satisfaction. (What you looked for is revealed as part of bigger scheme - but there is no continuation programmed in for it.)

Is this game really so broken?
If you like straightforward story, where you always can predict what outcome will come from your actions, Arcanum may let you frustrated. But if you like exploring every possibility, and repeating game over and over with new characters to find various endings Arcanum won't let you down.",1,1,0,14,1,2017-01-20,2017-01-20,0,7,8584,4468

"This is my second attempt at playing Arcanum; the first being about 14-15 years back at Gamestop on a disc copy. I got several hours in and just wasn't feeling it, but got it in a bundle on Steam recently and figured I'd give it another go. Perhaps I simply misjudged it back then when I tired of it? Here are my thoughts, taking into consideration my original efforts and my more recent, brief time with the game.

[h1]Graphics/Art Style[/h1]
Although some of the backgrounds look nice, virtually everything else (the characters/NPCs, items, enemies, user interface, ""movies"" and enemies) looked very unattractive to me. As an RPG made in the west in that era, this means the game inevitably went for realism in its appearance over art style. I would dare say that except for when anything very steampunk-y is on screen, the game feels quite lacking in visual artistic value. When you're going through a steampunk-meets-fantasy world, you expect some cool visuals and memorable locations, but I rarely encountered anything along those lines, in my opinion. The game doesn't look terrible, but it's just a bit drab and the user interface felt a bit cluttered for me.

[h1]Story/Characters/Lore[/h1]
Despite having played for a good 8 hours or so on the disc version and for a little bit on the Steam version, the story never grabbed me, nor can I even begin to remember it. Normally, plots come rushing back to me when I see a little bit of them again, but not with this one, as its start was uninteresting to me, nor was it fun. That said, I can overlook a story that isn't amazing if the characters are really likable or the lore/setting intrigue me. For instance, Vampire - The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a game this same developer put out 3 years after Arcanum. VtM Bloodlines is my favorite game, but quite frankly, I don't think its story is all that great. However, its cast of characters were more enjoyable for me than any other game I can think of, and the lore enriched everything while the setting positively oozed atmosphere in the best of ways.

Arcanum, on the other hand, has no characters I remember from my original time playing, and no one I liked when I played again briefly more recently. A fantasy/steampunk setting sounds awesome but is woefully under-used in games, but Arcanum's setting never held any atmospheric weight for me. I feel they completely missed the mark on utilizing such a setting to make a game I could find fun and interesting. The only potential saving grace at that point would be phenomenal gameplay, which I will discuss later.

[h1]Locations & Map UI[/h1]
This segment is about both the actual areas you run around in, as well as the maps you can pull up (map user interface) to see where you are in an area. The outdoor areas you run around in are quite large, and will often let you run for a couple of minutes or so in any given direction off the edge of the relevant portions of the map. While it's nice to not get rudely yanked out of an area a la older Final Fantasy games when taking one step too far on the edge of town, having so much ""dead space"" on maps is an odd choice without any payoff, which only made exploration more unappealing for me when it's normally pretty fun.

What makes matters even worse is that these areas are devoid of anything to do aside from the occasional enemy to kill or one or two points of interest. Searching the map I started on, there is zeppelin wreckage with bodies to loot, but after walking away from that, I explored the map for a bit and about 90% of my time was spent just walking around in a bland area, not fighting, not getting items, not seeing anything neat or mysterious, not meeting characters, and just generally bored and quickly remembering why I never finished the game my first time with it. The map after it is a house with nothing around it, and the one after that is a town with several acres in different directions with nothing to do on them either. Also, to go to the world map, you can't fast travel from a safe/non-combat zone; rather, you have to go to one of these dead zones away from anything relevant, and then go to the world map to select the next area to visit.

Unless your game has high-speed transportation within each map to make up for all the dead space (a la Grand Theft Auto games), then you need to compact your maps the way games like Batman Arkham Asylum, VtM Bloodlines, Deus Ex Games, and others have done. While unrealistic to have so much content so tightly packed together, it makes for a fun experience and at the end of the day, it's a video game, and I believe fun should be top priority above all else.

The user interface of the map you pull up involves clicking destinations on the local map/area you're in, relative to your character. You can click up to three points, then tell your character to go and he/she will travel to them...unless even the slightest obstacle is in the way that you didn't see on the map, in which case your instructions for your character will not be followed. The map just feels clunky to me and lacking details that could be helpful. The entire map system did not appeal to me.

[h1]Spells[/h1]

There are 80 spells for those interested in using them, like I was, but many are either too situational to ever have much use, with a few decent buff spells and about 4 or 5 decent damage-dealing spells (only 9 spells in the game deal damage), and you'll typically spam one spell in an area, giving mages combat that is no more involved than the most basic of melee tank characters in RPGs. Just look at the Wizard in Diablo III to see useful and exciting spell variety.

[h1]Instruction Manual & In-Game Tool-Tips[/h1]
This game's manual lacks a table of contents, so I had to use the search option on the word ""fatigue."" 102 instances of it in the manual, which took forever and did not have the info I needed. The game and instruction manual does not have details about fatigue regeneration in them, so I had to resort to searching the Steam Forums to find the info I needed. 

A complicated RPG system is okay, as long as the info about the crucial attributes you have to choose between is available to you within the manual or the game itself, and that is not the case with a lot of things in this game. After reading the forum, I discovered that one of the mages I created, which need Fatigue to cast spells, would [i]never[/i] regenerate fatigue because one attribute (not the Fatigue one) was too low...but neither the game's tooltips nor its instruction manual tell you about this at all.

[h1]Real-Time Vs Turn-Based Gameplay[/h1]
This game is designed so you can play it in real-time or have it pause to go into turn-based combat. Unfortunately, it feels very much like this caused problems more than anything. When trying to navigate the world, that's where the zig-zagging movement comes from (hidden grids for the areas), and when fighting in real-time, combat feels too fast. I do recommend skimming other reviews for more about the problems with playing in either mode, because the game has problems either way you do it (i.e. there are slow enemies who are supposed to catch up to ranged players and hit them when turn-based, but you'll simply outrun/kite them and blast/shoot them without any threat in real-time. The developers really needed to spend more time on this game to have its combat feel right, in my opinion.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
This game undoubtedly has many fans, as the setting is something that sounds like I would love to explore it. I don't recall much about the music, but I do remember a couple of nice songs, and the olde English dialog has charm. However, I simply cannot get into this game as most everything in Arcanum disenchants me with the game. If you really want an atmospheric CRPG that's ""old-school,"" then Fallout 2 or PlaneScape Torment are the way to go, in my opinion. They are games that are a few years older than Arcanum, but are better in virtually every regard, to me.",0,0,0,6,0,2017-01-12,2017-02-05,2057,736,162,162

"Arcanum.  Arcanum is a FANTASTIC title and should be sought out by players who enjoy Crpgs. Long story short, did you play Fallout 1 + 2 and really enjoy them, but haven't played Arcanum? Then get Arcanum NOW! Earliest memories of this game was back when I was around 12-13 years old, watching my sister and dad play it, and eventually myself. We each had our own saves and we poured HUNDREDS of hours, easily between the three of us, into this game.

The style of the game, dialogue, lore, the choices you can make, the freedom, and a world that has a growing rift between technology and magic (magick as its referred to) was just so fresh back in the day. A great ""classless"" leveling system allows you to create a character based on your playstyle, allowing you to progress through the game and interacting with npcs, the way YOU want to. Currently running an Evil Sorcerer (where as I was a goody Holy Knight who fancies a revolver as well) and NPCs react SO much differently than they did in my previous walkthrough, and some merchants comment my magical power...gunsmiths and armorers sometimes REFUSE to give me service, afraid I'm going to blow up their shop and stock! Even story quest NPCs, which some I ended up murdering for being so ""out of place"". Would that just end the story, NOPE, lets just say...that being a Sorcerer, I can ""pull"" them back for a bit and get what I need to progress through the story. 

Of course you have various side quests that can have various outcomes as well. I actually read a review stating that you have to ""slowly"" level to even do the most basic side quests. This claim is false. Yes there are side quests as well as the main story that can be harder to complete at a lower level, but thats how the game is...it gradually increases difficulty. The most ""basic"" side/main story quests can be completed at low levels...even lvl 1 which you won't be at for long anyway. 

Unfortunately, there are bugs present now given the game is being ran on modern systems, unless you're using a mircrowave pc given today's standards. There are some unofficial fan base patches that are MANDATORY for the game's successful launch on modern pcs. Look up Drog's Unofficial Arcanum Patch, as this is the one you need primarily. If you choose the run the game without mandatory patches, or fail to install them correctly, don't blame the game for having issues running on a modern pc and you being incapable. The game runs, as proven by my 40hrs logged. 

The combat honestly could've been better. Stiff animations and rather dull after awhile. Especially spell casting...you just stand there regardless of the spell. I do enjoy that they have the option for real time or turn base combat. Customization is ""great"", but visually...not so much. There isn't much depth for visual customization, but there is plenty of character customization.

I play a wide variety of games, but honestly, Arcanum has by far brought me the most enjoyment...solidifying the fact that a great game doesn't need amazing graphics, certain game modes, fuck ton of crazy features, etc etc. Arcanum has just...done it right for me. Sometimes people ask me for my favorite movie, which I answer without hesitation. As for game...I really haven't had an answer for it. Till I found this on Steam and RUSHED right to it, having played through it and just sparking up some really great memories. No other game has really brought me that kind of joy in a long time, if not, ever. The world is immersive and I easily see myself playing it on and off in the future. I finally decided that my favorite game is Arcanum. I actually save old PC boxes from back in the day, well I dug it out, and now have it placed on my wall shelf for display.

Despite some negatives, which are easily overlooked and minor, this game is remarkable for what it is and what it offers the player. Arcanum truely is a fantastic game which deserves a spot in your library

"Когда то давно, году этак 2003-2004 я купил Arcanum. Сначала я не оценил всей прелести этой игры, т.к. искал diablo клон. Но сосед по общаге знал собака про эту игру и ничего мне не сказав, взял поиграть, а когда прошел, поведал мне про мир магии и технологии... И я запал... Учеба в институте ушла на второй план, я не высыпался, но я прошел эту игру три раза, на одном дыхании... Но, печаль - беда, когда съезжал с общаги, кто-то скомуниздил диск с игрой (и я подозреваю, кто) Миша, я знаю, это ты ))). Потом я купил еще один пиратский диск с ужасной локализацией... (тогда интернета еще не было у меня). И вот, купил в Steam, дабы отдать дань уважения разработчикам... Боюсь её запускать... Ведь это же не просто игра, это целый мать его мир... Arcanum, как Джуманджи просто затягивает тебя в свой мир и не отпускает до финальных титрорв...

"First, despite the lack of time recorded on the game I did finish the game. I couldn't get the game to run with the launcher, so I ran the game itself and that worked.
Second, it's not a bad game, but I had too many issues with the game. I didn't try any mods. The game has a lot of bugs and glitches and just lack of proper information. I picked a random character and found myself struggling to do anything at the beginning. You must slowly level up before you can even do the most basic of quests. It's hard to tell exactly what you're supposed to do on most quests. The log usually doesn't show any helpful information. You will have to google several things the first time you play the game. A lot of people seem to play the game a second time, probably because you can't actually figure out the game until you've finished the game. Even after finishing the game it is hard to figure out many things. Why does magic healing not work on a technologist, but a fireball does. The stats on weapons are often clear as mud. I wasted a lot of level up points to learn tech, so I could make stuff I'd just find anyway. I think 20 years in game time went by, but my character is still 20 years old and nothing changes with time. There are lots of other small issues I have with the game that I won't get into.
So finally to sum it all up, it's an okay game, lots of potential, but unless they remake the game I just can't recommend this one.",0,1,0,9,1,2017-01-01,2017-01-01,0,9,16,16

"This is the Deus Ex of RPGs (insofar as Deus Ex is not really an RPG). I mean that comparison in a number of ways, including the negative ones: unimpressive (even at the time) graphics, and the unpatched (or even patched) bugginess. But more to the point, Arcanum is reminiscent of DE in terms of the sheer breadth and scope of its ambition, as well as the complexity and [i]honesty[/i] of its mechanics. 

Everything Arcanum does, it does [i]in the gameworld[/i], playing by its own established rules. If there's an item to be recovered for a quest, that item exists in the world, and you can steal it or smash open the container / person holding it, in lieu of any dialog options. If your reward for that quest is a different item, that item [i]also[/i] exists within the game world.  Whatever you trying to accomplish, you can accomplish ""as intended"" or whichever way you want to, within the rules of the game. 

Let's compare with a recent outstanding RPG - The Witcher 3. If a plague-ridden peasant begs the Witcher to kill him, and you select the ""refuse"" dialog option, that's it. That's the end of the quest, because you can't actually interact with non-hostile peasants if they don't want to speak to you. Swing your swords, throw bombs around, lure a terrifying monster to the village - everyone will cower briefly, then go about their day. The peasant ""NPC"" is just scenery - a bit of graphics and voice-acting provided with a few highly limited ways to interact with the gameworld.

But isn't that [i]all[/i] that NPCs ever are? What else could they possibly be? 

Well, they could be fully realized characters (mechanically, not in terms of writing), just as ""real"" to the game as you or your companions, as all NPCs in Arcanum are. You can steal their clothes and weapons, or give them armor and swords to turn them into warriors. You can dominate just about every NPC into joining your party and - since they are ""real"" to the game - every misbegotten random passerby can be leveled up and equipped into a blazing god of murder. Alternately, you can play dressup with them by stealing and planting clothes, or plant a poisonous item / stick of dynamite on them just for fun.

[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52_ZyndqeLI]NPCs will react[/url] to your characters race, stats, intelligence, magical / technological inclination, manner of dress,  being invisible, having a summon along... and more. On the other hand, the game features exactly two invulnerable NPCs, and you can finish the game by slaughtering every single person you meet without ever talking to more than then the handful of people who start a conversation on their own.

If you are playing an idiot, you won't just get the occasional ""me stupid"" dialog option - the entirety of your dialog and journal options will be idiotic ""Hulk-speak"" ([i]including journal entries for quests you can only undertake as an intelligent character![/i]). The difference between an elven mage, an idiotic half-ogre fighter or a dwarven technologist lies not just in a small number of different dialog choices or the exact flavor of pew-pew they unleash upon the enemy - each of the three is going to have a completely different gameplay experience. The game is just way too vast to experience all of it in one playthrough. Even if you go for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818649577]mastery of all skills[/url] (a walkthrough already calculated to exploit game mechanics in order to see as much content as possible), you probably won't see more than 80% of what the game has to offer. 

It's really goddamned amazing, and I heartily recommend it.",1,0,0,47,1,2016-12-27,2020-12-18,1490,153,7319,7235

"THIS IS AN OLD GAME! Be warned!! I recommend to do a quick Google after buying this game and install some essential mods such as the HD mod and community patch. You will need to do some configuring before this game is playable in this day and age, however it is WELL worth the wait.

PROS:
- Pretty decent story
- Amazing character customisability
- Item-size based inventory management
- Many secrets and side-quests to find
- Real attention to detail
- Freedom in style of play (real time or turn-based, being good/evil and magic/tech minded, almost everything you can imagine!)
- Multiplayer support
- A ""quick-travel"" kind of option
- Great writing and voice acting (especially for the time)

CONS:
- Even with the latest official and community patches installed, there are many bugs in the game (no ""game-breaking"" ones though)
- It is difficult to get started in the game; there isn't a tutorial, and due to the sheer customisability it's a bit of a learning curve to understand what works well (but a quick Google can help)
- It is an old game, so the ""steam version"" is basically unplayable on a modern computer

TLDR:
If you're in the market for a good RPG and you love the steampunk/magic kind of universe, and of course don't mind installing a few quick mods, then THIS GAME IS A MUST-BUY!",1,1,0,19,1,2016-12-27,2016-12-27,524,25,353,335

"Это лучшее, что случилось со мной на этой распродаже. Я и представить не мог, что найду это в Steam. Arcanum это не игра, это полноценное художественное произведение. Очень вариативное, очень личное и великолепное во всем. Три раза за неё брался, 2 раза игра обрывалась после сотни часов из-за багов на пиратских дисках с рынка, на третий - удалось таки пройти. Это квинтессенция всего того хорошего, что было в детстве. Почти как чувства от первого просмотра трилогии Звёздных Войн, когда она только вышла.

Да, графика устарела, да, тонны текста, но это того стоит. Рад, что теперь своим детям смогу показать это замечательное приключение.

"I've played many RPGs in my time; not many of them come near as close to what this is. I've heard of Arcanum in passing before on several video game forums but never garnered enough interest to give it a shot. I'm kind of kicking myself now for not doing so earlier.

     This is more than just a game, it's an experience. An experience that's been holding every hour of my free time in recent days. From the world building to exploration, dialogue to combat, everything has been crafted so well that I was pleasantly surprised once I had the ball rolling. I wasn't expecting much going into it, many games from the early two-thousands aged rather poorly, but this is like a bottle of scotch. It's a fantastic representation of what RPGs once were, when minute detail and thought went into what the player might experience, when cause and effect actually showed results and didn't shoehorn you into one path. If you make a decision in Arcanun, unless you savescum it's permanent. 

     So far I can't honestly think of anything about this game that I would speak negatively about, I haven't experienced any bugs yet, the difficulty has been challenging, I've been more immersed than I have in years; I keep wanting to continue and see where things go.

"I held off on a review 'til a few hours in.  
No bugs (Win7), so my thousands of hours of gameplay over the past fifteen years count toward this review.
I don't agree with the ""Steampunk"" tag for this game.  Nothing punk about it.  What it is, is classic high fantasy a few hundred years down the road from its usual setting, where the industrial age is just beginning.
The story is engaging at times, full of gaps at others, though personally I think it's much more fleshed out than Baldur's Gate I or II, and the combat is much more rewarding.  Honestly the biggest reason I keep coming back to this game year after year is planning out and building a character based off of a set amount of skill points (the same reason I turn back to Diablo II every couple of years).  If you enjoy character buidling, and are looking for a story that-despite plot holes-can really suck you in at times, give it a try.  I have two copies on CD ROM, and this was still probably the best $3.59 I've spent on Steam this year.  I've hoped and dreamed for a sequel/remake/anything new over the years to bring attention back to this wonderful game.

A masterpiece of an RPG. I played well over 1000 hours at this game when i was younger and had the CD version of it. Loosing that cd shatered my heart as this is, in my opinion the best RPG ever made according to what i have played so far.

In Arcanum, freedom is the name of the game. Of course it is still a game and is restricted by the amount of content it has but even then, there seems to be an endless stream of it. Make any caracter you want, from a fighter, mage, gunslinger, armorer, archer, thieve, assassin to a diplomat, you can do it. I cannot guaranty your build will pull you out of every situation but nothing ever will eh!

It has its few bugs and old graphs but this doesnt mar the beauty of the game itself, not to speak of the godly steampunk-violin soundtrack wich only helps in keeping you immersed.

"I know it doesn't say I have many hours in this game. It's because I own it on original CD Rom. But let me tell you, I have poured hours into it. I've beaten it at least half a dozen times.

It was hard to get into the first time I played it. I just didn't understand some of the mechanics, and the enemies were tough for a beginner. I didn't pick it up again for about a year. When I finally did pick it up again, I grew very immersed. The level of impact you have on the world blew my mind. No other game has ever truly captured a character's impact than this game has. The only game since that even came close would be Pillars of Eternity.

You're in this massive world with no knowledge of its workings, other than what a mysterious stranger tells you. In order to truly understand it, you must travel the length and bredth of an entire continent. And huge isn't an overstatement. But it's incredibly fleshed out. Every location has its problems and charms, and everything you do in those locations will have a significant impact on the world. You could kill a seemingly innocent man, but for all you know, he could have been the heir to a kingdom. You'd never know until you've worked out how to put him on the throne.

After researching and finding and applying mods (and then fixes/workarounds for running it in Windows 10, or non-800x600 resolution) and then finding the .dll files etc.  I still found that I couldn't even buy things in shops, because the shop scroll arrows are bugged out and I have now given up.

Not just that, but random crashing, the combat system, navigating the separate screens; so much stuff is a royal pain in the proverbials with this game.

Getting it to work feels like work and not play. I have requested my refund.

Notice how a lot of positive reviews have 0.2hours, 0.6 hours.  These people have consumed many Member Berries.

EDIT:
My Steam refund did not get approved as I was over the play time limit.

Now I have played some more of the game and fixed the inventory scrolling problem (I have disabled scrolling and am using my touchpad), I am starting to enjoy it more",0,1,0,51,1,2016-12-06,2016-12-10,0,3,953,848
"It looks complicated, but the game actually plays pretty simply once you figure it out. Story is great, lots of good voice acting, delicious hammy early cgi cutscenes, and a uniquely crafted world by the guys who made Fallout.
Only complaint is that it's buggy. The game also freaks out if you alt tab, so never do it unless you want to risk a corrupted save. I'm sure there's patches out there that fix the game.",1,1,0,11,0,2016-12-05,2016-12-05,0,35,56,55

"I will review all my humble bundle games and see which is worth playing and which is not! Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a little bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total disappointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!

The review will be constructed into 5 parts:
1. Game description (from what I’ve seen in the time I’ve played).
2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.
3. Pros/Cons.
4. Final thoughts.
5. Rating

So let's begin...

1. Game description:

A classical RPG with big character development and an isometric view.  It has some steampunk elements thrown in. The gameplay is what you would expect from a game this age, a little clunky by modern standards.

2. Did i finish the game? NO/ Maybe in the future

I like RPG’s, however the same thing happened when I played for the first time fallout 1 a couple of years ago. The mechanics and graphics where just to outdated for me. Maybe I will finish it someday for the story, but that is very unlikely.

3. Pros/Cons.

PROS:
- Classical RPG – big nostalgia value for someone who played it when it was released.
- Nice athosphere

CONS:
- Outdated graphics and controls 

4. Final thoughts:

Bought this with the Sierra Bundle. It wasn't a game i played when i was little so i don't have any emotional atachment to it. If you like classical RPG and aren’t bothered by the outdated controls, go for it. It just wasn’t for me…

"Arcanum is a truly unique gem of its time, and is still one of my favorite games to play 10 years later after playing it for the first time. This is one of the first open world games before Oblivion, Fallout III, and GTA III. This is one of the few games that captures the essense of D&D while putting its own twist in the mix without breaking the immersion to the experience. The lore is rich, and the attributes matter. If you only have 1 Charisma you will speak broken English, and the NPCs will riducule you. I can not speak highly enough of this game, and I've spent hundreds of hours playing the disc version.

Only one  complaint: it is impossible at the moment to play this game in a window and with the right resolution without using mods. I personally cant stand using mods, but for some people this might not be a problem. I also hear it doesn't run that great on Windows 10 but since I don't have it, I can only speak for Windows 7 users. 

Definitely worth buying at full price.

"An amazing game!
I have played a LOT of games in my life, but this one is the best in the following categories:

+ best story:
not your average ""hero saves the world"" thing, includes a lot of twists
+ most interesting world:
magic and technology exist both and oppose each other. both are exciting and awesome! you can discover powerful evil magic or incredible ancient technology in this world! orcs, dwarfs, elfs and humans struggle to find a place in the industrial revolution.
+ i never saw better written dialogs
+ an rpg which actually offers intersting and legit peaceful solutions through persuasion! unique!
+ not the best, but still awesome music!

sadly a few weak points are important to mention too:
- old graphics that become decent with some modding efforts
- boring and rather unbalanced fights
- buggy if you do not mod it, with mods its not bug free but ok

"I have extremely fond memories of playing Arcanum. This is a gem that truly stands the test of time, set in a world where magick and technology coexist. Character progression is very interesting where you are barely limited by your actions. You can be a thief and loot an armor store in the dark of night to obtain better equiptment. Oh but the armor chest is locked? Just pickpocket the key from the owners pockets when he is fast asleep which increases your chances of succeeding! Soundtrack has a nice violin melancholic feel to it, made fitting in a world consumed by an industrial and technological revolution that is hellbent in suppressing magic users. Without giving any spoilers, the main quest is refreshing and the subquests intriguing at best with tons of alternative options to choose from. To top it off, theres a good modding community-following for Arcanum as well by the folks over at Terra-Arcanum who has done some amazing job like unnoficial patches, higher resolution fixes, and others.

"Фоллаут в стимпанковском фэнтези сеттинге. Очень недооцененная игра в свое время которой не повезло релизнуться между выходом Diablo 2:LOD и Baldur's Gate 2. Однако, если вас интересует классика рпг, то перед вами ее ярчайший представитель, с невероятной глубиной мира что реагирует на вашего героя и ваш отыгрыш, с яркими персонажами на личность которых можно влиять и квестами что имеют несколько путей прохождения, не всегда очевидных. Все это вместе с чудесной атмосферой викторианской эпохи смешанной с типичными средневековыми клише дает отличную реиграбельность, даже спустя годы. 

Разумеется, баланс должен соблюдаться и потому, несмотря на вышеперечисленное в игре есть минусы в виде отсутствия баланса в самой механике игры. Можете запросто пройти игру с одним спеллом который дают вам в начале. 
Недоработки боевой системы. Так с реал-таймом уходит тактика и начинается какой-то содом. Особенно если вкачать ловкость и взять двуручний меч. Будете носится как угорелый между врагами не оставляя тем даже шанса на удар. 
Про графику и говорить нечего. Действительно нечего, она была устаревшей даже на момент выхода. И конечно же баги оригинальной версии. Без обмазывания каким-нибудь Arcanum Multiverse Edition эта игра у вас может банально не запуститься.

И все-таки хорошо что Арканум появился в стиме. Это как встретиться со старым другом детства. Словно все эти годы что разделили вас исчезли и вместе вы снова отыскали в своей душе светлые воспоминания которые ничуть не поблекли.

"Arcanum is a classic RPG, with excellent writing, and a unique fantasy-steampunk setting where technology and magic clash. The character creation is superb and leaves you with many different ways to play through the game, with such fantastic backgrounds as 'special person', running away with the circus, beat with an ugly stick, charlatans protege, and many more that are quite unique. This all leads up to multiple ways to solve problems, and not everything is accessable with just one character like many RPG's today. If you have played the original Fallout games, and somehow passed over this, then it is worth a look.

That said, it does have its downsides, it was buggy at release, and still has a few today. The combat can be switched from real time to turn based, and as a result can be unbalanced in one or the other in differing situations, and it leaves the animations are a little clunky.

Затем шло погружение в прекрасный, гигантский и отрисованный с благоговением к детялям, ни на что не похожий мир, который смотрится необычно и сейчас. Тогда же был более в диковинку хотя бы потому, что steampunk-сеттинги в играх никто толком не использовал. Что за нелепость - орки на бипланах с пушками Гатлинга и гномы с револьверами и бомбами? Да, детки, это неизбежный смог индустриализации 19-го века окутывает классическое кренделёчное фэнтези абстрактного Средневековья, расставляя на улицах газовые фонари, газетные киоски и подчиняя стихии машинами на паровых двигателях в крупнейших городах, например, в столичном Таранте. А где-то на периферии, в эльфийском поселении на деревьях Кинтарре или же в магическом анклаве Тулле (без пряников, ружей и самоваров, к сожалению) дороги переливаются цветными огоньками волшебного происхождения. И если в нашем с вами мире людей индустриализация увеличила раскол между бедняками и богачами, то здесь этот раскол углубился аж на идеологическом уровне. Да, одновремено можно владеть и знахарством, и воровством, и двуручным оружием, но нужно помнить, что всё магическое плохо вяжется с технологическим. И из предрасположенного к магии эльфа глупо лепить, скажем, сборщика винтовок/снайпера. 

Игроку, кстати, доступны представители максимально антропоморфных рас типа самих людей, полуэльфов, полуогров. Эльфов, полуросликов и гномов тоже выбрать можно, а вот орков - уже нет, только полуорков. Для персонажей женского пола вариантов ещё меньше. И если полуэльфы имеют все шансы стать богемными няшками, вхожими в любые общества, то полуорк будет чувствовать себя негром в Техасе 19-го века почти повсеместно. 

Куда пойти, куда податься, кого найти, кому отдаться - выбирайте сами в любой момент. Лично я полагался на красноречие, т.к. диалоги и описания Arcanum достойны отдельной книги. Что тогда, что сейчас, практически не встретишь RPG, вдохновлённых задымлённо-поэтичным очарованием серебряного века, где речи, проникнутые нарочитой вежливостью, могут долго и очень интересно ветивиться, позволяя игроку выбрать совершенно любую стезю. Минимум убийств и максимум соблазнений (да-да, секса тут немало, даже с овцами имеется) вкупе с забалтыванием? Пожалуйста, прокаченная харизма экономит массу времени и сил.

Помнится, в середине 00-х поляки из CD Project анонсировали Witcher как RPG с самой широкой палитрой совести. Не верьте - первым точно был Arcanum, где оттенков серого будет поболее, чем у вашего Дориана Грея. Ни поймешь кто хорош, а кто злодей, зачастую свойства переплетаются причудливым образом. Плюс, нельзя никому верить. Не разобравшись в ситуации, можно угробить святого, имея добрые намерения. ""Все лгут"", и задолго до того, как это стало мейнстримом.

Не отказывайте никому в обществе и станьте свидетелем колких, искромётных диалогов между разномастными персоналиями, особенно когда они становятся свидетелями чего-то, что идёт вразрез с их понятиями или же наоборот будит маниакальный интерес. Также любопытно время от времени в отпускать вожжи управления ситуацией и давать порулить сопартийцам. 

К боёвке же стоит привыкнуть. Поначалу используйте пошаговый режим.

Господи, благослови разработчиков из Troika! Благодаря ним за тот жаркий август-сентябрь 2001-го я выучил с сотню новых русских слов (""епитимья"", ""френология"", ""конденсатор"" и пр.) и раз в десять больше - английских, поскольку удивительно неплохая версия ""Фаргуса"" глючила, пришлось ставить оригинал. Благодаря ним нашёл в своём сердце место для любимой игры всей жизни. Это не просто игра, а памятник талантливым сценаристам, гейм-дизайнерам, художникам. Интеллектуальный RPG-детектив длиной в десятки часов. Когда за дело берутся профессионалы и берутся с любовью - зажигаются звёзды вроде Arcanum.

P.S. Утёр слезу умиления, когда обнаружил подтормаживания. 15 лет назад у меня кряхтел Celeron-433 с 96Мб памяти при появлении первых компаньонов, сейчас то же самое выдаёт Intel i5 с 16Гб оперативы и на SSD, причём уже в первых же пещерах.

"Ah, Arcanum. Where to begin with this truly unique gem? I bought this game when it first came out and boy did I sink the hours into it! Only thing that would make me happier than seeing it released on steam like it is now is if some kind soul made a sequel or updated the existing version to todays standards of graphics etc

tbh, even when it was first released the graphics were pretty sub-par but didn't matter too much as the actual story itself was very compelling with an astounding variety of ways to play the game all completely viable to finish the game with as most quests give multiple ways of completing them

Want to play a suave half-orc or a grenade throwing psychopath? A classic fireball throwing elf mage or a typical axe wielding dwarf? Rain-man style card counting jerk? the list goes on, thanks to the large array of ""backgrounds"" you can choose at character creation to help flesh out your character.

The aspects of the game though which I've yet to see in any other which really sets it apart though are the technology/magic alignment meter, which directly affects your aptitude to use certain items or cast spells and vice versa...e.g the mage who tries to use a gun only to find they critically fail more often than not or not able to cast that vital heal on your tech companion as the the gadgets they weild and can create (from steam-powered spider drones to tonics to boost stats to hand cannons etc) will fizzle.

Some companions will not join you if you do not meet a certain level of tech or magic aptitude.

There is also a moral alignment as you progress, adding again to the replayability as some companions you can add to your party will only join if you are of certain alignments and offering differing endings to the game depending on if your good or evil inclined.

The game when it was released though was absolutely riddled with some game-breaking bugs. thankfully though there are some great patches out there from fans, most notably the drog black-tooth patch which can be found here  fixes a large number of them but it is still highly recommended to save often and in multiple slots:

http://terra-arcanum.com/drog/dest/uap.html

The combat pretty basic and I wouldn't advise using ""real time"", if you're familiar with early fallout (1&2) you'll know what i mean.

Overall a great game, interesting story, unique concept, high replayability. graphics are outdated, combat is bit messed up. corrupted saves suck balls.

I can spend my whole evening listing good things about Arcanum. It's got politics, magic, technology, crafting, quests, sidequests, sidequests, what-happened-after ending slides (consequences), sidequests, gnomish conspiracies, a thick novel full of dialogue, resurrecting of NPCs, racism, talking to ghosts of dead NPCs, memorable followers, good voice acting, unique, excellent soundtrack, idiot playthrough, plot twists, books, newspapers, gossip, shops, vendors, trainers, master trainer quests, free roam, 30 hours of gameplay even if you play it through once, nostalgic value, steampunk, story, backstory, history, philosophy, humor, beauty. There's so much to discover and each new place you'll reach will amaze you once again. You're totally free to design your character and make your choices. Choices that matter. There's lots of content for completionists and the replay value is so high you'll want to go completionist all over again once you finish the first time around.

"It's a Crpg made by a few of the guys who worked on Fallout 1 & 2 including Tim Cain! Arcanum features spectacular story-writing, unprecedented freedom and an engaging world which offers a truly unique experience til this day.

Unfortunately, Arcanum was and still is poorly optimized which only hinders this experience for me. Low framerates (despite my  decently powerfulpc wirth a 980ti), simply because it wasn't coded right. Gave me headaches.

I understand why the game recieves amazing reviews on Steam, welcoming Troika's forst game to Steam with open arms. However, these reviews are based on the nostalgic experience of the game and I feel those reviews don't fairly represent this version.

Other problems include the horrible U.I which takes alot of time to get used to and an atrocious waypoint system. The combat is not as great as Fallout or Baldurs Gate either.

Please understand, I'm not trying to bash this game. It's a unique take on the Crpg formula. It has alot to offer and it's beautiful but I must speak out on this dreadful port. It's no wonder the community is asking for a remake. The fact that this version is getting great reviews is pretty ridiculous.... all because people can't take off their nostalgia goggles which are blinding them. If we keep supporting crap ports, we'll only continue to get crap ports.

"Arcanum: Of Streamworks and Magick Obscura. Сама игра довольно древняя (вышла примерно в 2001 году), однако дух её по-прежнему в сердцах многих тысяч поклонников. Графика игры уже вряд ли впечатлит любителя компьютерных rpg. По этой же причине многим не захочется вникать в игровой процесс. А зря, поскольку игра — одна из тех немногих по-настоящему«интеллектуальных» ролевых игр. Разработчик Troika Games. А издатель (та самая) Sierra Online, на счету которой были по настоящему Оригинальные Игры.

[b]На момент выхода игра была дико популярна среди ролевого комьюнити, откровенно заждавшегося третьего Фоллаута. Тем не менее игра имела ограниченный успех (всего 230 000 проданных экземпляров, выручка  $8,8 млн.). Арканум, к сожалению, не вытянул Troika Games из финансового кризиса, и, просуществовав ещё четыре года, «Тройка» в 2005 году окончательно умерла.[/b]

[b]История выбранного персонажа (будь то человек, карлик, гном, полурослик, эльф, полуэльф, полуорк, или полуогр) начинается с крушения  дирижабля.[/b]

[h1]Каков будет ваш путь в Аркануме - решаете только Вы. Хотите ли вы стать благородным героем, или же будете безжалостным бандитом? Каков ваш выбор — магия или технология, а может и то и другое? В любом случае, ваше решение в корне изменит Ваш Путь в игре. В Аркануме вы можете по настоящему жить. Хотите, например, отдохнуть после выматывающих приключений — никто не мешает вам зайти в таверну и там напиться. Или же — навестите Бордель Мадам Лил в Таранте. Уверен — для вас найдётся что-то по душе.[/h1]

Конечно, приятнее путешествовать в компании. В Аркануме находятся немало существ, готовых сопровождать вас в ваших странствованиях. Будь то маг, или же гном-технолог. А может вы захотите собрать свою группировку, готовую броситься за вас в огонь и в воду?
Тогда будьте готовы к междоусобицам между вашими спутниками. Ведь каждый из них индивидуален, и согласится с вами идти лишь на своих условиях.
Арканум - игра из очень редкой категории игр, жанра стимпанк. В этом жанре живут «под одной крышей» и магия и технология. К этому жанру относятся такие игры как ""Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends"", ""Не время для драконов"", ""Wizardry"" и некоторые другие.

[h1]Вечное противостояние Магии и Технологии — суть Арканума и основа его Вселенной. В Аркануме существуют такие техногенные вещи как метро, поезда, дирижабли, телеграфы, электричество, паровые машины и многое другое. В то же время в самых технологично развитых городах, таких как Тарант или Каладон, рядом с метро находится магический магазин с магическими свитками и посохами. Это порождает массу конфликтов и распрей, перерождающихся в полномасштабные войны, такие как Таранто-Камбрийская Война, вследствие которой Камбрия практически перестала существовать. Или же — уничтожение Мерцающего Леса, извечного обиталища эльфов, гномами и людьми.[/h1]

У многих рас существуют предрасположенности к магии или технологии. Не думайте, что выросший под шум паровых машин гном будет с успехом обучатся магии! Ну и, естественно, остроухий эльф навряд ли сумеет соорудить гранату.

В игре присутствует ряд умений, какие можно развивать, тем самым делая более безопасной и комфортной свою жизнь в Аркануме. Например — те же ловушки. В лесу, в подземелье — ловушки могут портить вам жизнь всё время, если вы не обучитесь навыку Обнаружение Ловушек. Впрочем, у технологов и магов, есть свои «финты» с ловушками, которые можно выучить только глубоко погрузившись в ту или иную область.

Если вы любите огнестрельное оружие — прокачайте этот навык, чтобы стрелять ещё точнее и сильнее. Если же вас всю жизнь тянуло к воровству или взлому — попробуйте научиться этим навыкам, и вы не пожалеете. А если вы прирожденный торговец выучитесь этому ремеслу, и перед вами раскроются все хитрости торговли. Существует еще масса других полезных умений, которые немало вам помогут.

[b]Arcanum - огромный неисследованный мир и кладезь находок в подходе к созданию игры. Мир, который позволяет оценить всю любовь, вложенную демиургами - разработчиками в своё творение.[/b]

[h1]Проходят годы, но Arcanum, как хорошее вино, становится всё более и более выдержанным и приятным на вкус, вызывая приятные воспоминания о тех временах, когда не было технической возможности создать реалистичную графику, и разработчики стремились придумывать что то новое, необычное, атмосферное для привлечения внимания игрока.[/h1]

[b]Незабываемых Вам похождений в мире магии и технологии, друзья![/b]

[quote]P.S. На дворе 2017-й, а ничего даже близко похожего на эту игру так и не выпустили. Делайте выводы, друзья - не все то плохо, что старьё и не всё новое это хорошо![/quote]

"What can I say: 30 hours of playtime in less than a week!

Got it recently for six bucks to remember the good old days. One of the best RPGs (and one of the best games ever). 

Strongly recommended, even if will be your first time with this gem. Once you get used to the old school graphics: excellent gameplay and tons and tons of high-quality content.

Following the instructions for optimizing the game (community) is a must if you're with Win10. Otherwise performance is crappy.

"Oh man. Oh man oh man. What a throwback. What an amazing game. It's surprising the amount of content this little beaut holds. I played this as a kid, and now I'm right back to it. I tried to get it to run about a year ago, but there were too many problems with the compatibility. Whoever thought of putting this on steam was a genius. This game has so much to do and so much character customization. Seems like 89% of modern games out there fall short of this epic; let me remind you it was a game released for PC in 2001. It was released 3 days before Windows XP.

The system is standard with spice. You have your basic stats, 16 schools of magic with 4 spells each, 8 branches of technology with 7 recipes, and 4 branches of skills (combat, thieving, social, and technological), . All use the same points on level-up (you only get 1 a level). You might have a bit of a hard time at the start, so here's a tip- you need 9 Charisma to get Sogg Mead Mug at the Shrouded Hills Inn, otherwise it'll be hard to pass the bridge thieves. That's all you get from me. I toiled at this game a lot back when it came out and any further tips would ruin the experience. I just don't want anyone throwing it aside in the beginning.

For 6 dollars, this is a steal. The amount of gameplay time is staggering. I have a friend who's a downright gamernazi about his games and he's beat this game 6 times with different outcomes. There's more than one main quest and your choices will effect the overall outcome of the game. Remember this when playing - there is no technomagick. You can't be magically adept and wield a gun. It's a disaster if you try. There ARE however techno-staves that hurl electricity. You can fulfill your technomancer dream with that.

Here's a list of pros and cons if you didn't want to read all that:

PROS
- Amazing customization
- Optional turn based or realtime combat at the push of the space bar
- Dozens of hundreds of items
- Optional followers
- Tons of choices in dialogue
- Deep story
- Beautiful world
- Make your own character portraits (google it)
- WHAT'S THAT BETWEEN THE ""O"" AND THE ""U"" IN GREY MOUNTAINS?!

CONS
- HUD is clunky and outdated (what did you expect?)
- Some indoor places are barren of decor and some objects/furniture are put in asinine places
- Hope you like critically missing and hitting yourself or party members in combat a lot early on
- Unless you have the resurrect spell, get used to party member permadeath, or reloading
- Autopathing is a bit frustrating
- Guns/bows require point for point ammunition... and has carryweight... per ammo (a pro if you're hardcore)

"The only reason Arcanum isn't well known as the all-time classic that it is, is because it was released right between Diablo 2:Lord Of Destruction, and Baldur's Gate 2:Throne Of Bhaal.
They were massively popular expansions to massively popular games that essentially shared the same general visual style and similar gameplay to Arcanum, a game no one had ever heard of.
Naturally, it went overlooked in favor of the vastly more famous expansions.

Arcanum is an absolute masterpiece.
As much as I LOVE Diablo 2:Lord Of Destruction, I'm NOT sure that it was the best isometric PC game to come out that year.
Arcanum MAY be the better game.

Imagine everything you love about the Fallout games and Elder Scrolls games, and imagine a steampunk version in a DRAMATICALLY more elaborate and interesting world, with more depth, and more customization, but in isometric 2D, like the original Fallout games.
Arcanum was created by the creators of Fallout.
It IS steampunk Fallout.

I'll be real honest, if they told me that a new Fallout or Elder Scrolls game was on the way, I'd shrug.
That's cool.
But if they told me they were making Arcanum 2, I'd be LOSING MY GORRAM MIND waiting day by day for that game to come out. I've been waiting for Arcanum 2 to be announced for like 15 years.",1,1,0,71,7,2016-09-20,2016-09-20,0,17,37,37

"Купил Арканум, как извинение за то, что с детства играл только в пиратку от фаргуса.
В целом огромное спасибо тройкагемс за эту потрясающую игру! В свое время я в ней просидел колосально долго. Никаких прохожденй небыло, руководств и подсказок. Проходил разными персонажами в слепую! Хотя порой сжигал карточки WEB+ для диалап модема, общаясь в чате с такими же как я игроками и делились эмоциями и советами! Ох! Сейчас скачал из стима, накатил моды и опять окунулся в эмоции детства... Ощущения не передаваемые!",1,1,0,15,1,2016-09-17,2016-09-17,747,23,13,13
"Я купил эту игру немедленно, как только увидел ее в Стиме. Собственно, можно не продолжать =)

Игра старая, местами недоработан баланс, стоит доводить до ума модами... и все равно это одна из лучших компьютерных игр, которые я знаю. А знаю я их много :) Меня могут закидать помидорами, но Arcanum лучше Fallout, любого. И да, в Аркануме есть паровая броня (на ма-а-аленьком паровом двигателе) ^_^

Рекомендую купить, поставить и пройти.
А потом найти хорошее руководство, понять, что вы упустили, и пройти еще раз.
Потом создать какого-нибудь безумного персонажа (гном-маг с пистолетом и минимальным интеллектом, скажем) и пройти еще раз.

Плюсов в игре множество.
Это действительно ролевая игра - диалоги здесь не просто для подачи сюжета, как в недавних Pillars of Eternity или Divinity - OS. Туповатый громила будет взаимодействовать с миром иначе, чем мудрый маг или хитрый дипломат.
Широкий выбор возможностей. Хотите крафт - пожалуйста. Не хотите - можно обойтись совсем без. Хотите магию - 16 классов заклинаний (""школ"") к вашим услугам. Не хотите - рыцарь с двуручником тоже может за себя постоять. Разве что нельзя охватить все сразу ;) Кого-то это расстроит.
Можно быть суровым воином-одиночкой. Можно быть незримым ниндзя. Можно быть мудрым магом, призывающим на помощь могучих существ (звери, нежить, элементали - все сразу или по отдельности). Можно быть харизматичным болтуном, окруженным толпой спутников, готовых положить за Избранного жизнь - а ему даже пальцем о палец ударить не придется. Все эти варианты разные - и все равноценные.
Есть много неочевидных вещей. Есть целые города, которые я обнаружил только на третье прохождение.
Из не совсем очевидных вещей, есть одна важная, которуя я узнал спустя пару прохождений, и которая может пригодиться сразу. У навыков есть уровень владения, и мастерство. И это разные вещи. Уровень владения можно вкачать за очки. Мастерству надо учиться у NPC, и найти учителя для максимального мастерства - та еще задача. Пример отличия (по памяти) - навык ""убеждение"". Уровень владения определяет количество спутников. А мастерство помогает со спутниками общаться. Максимальное мастерство ""убеждения"" позволяет убедить спутника не покидать вас, даже если спутник будет вас ненавидеть. Обычно же, если действия героя идут вразрез с убеждениями спутника, то ваши дороги разойдутся.

В общем, я могу писать об этой игре еще долго, но зачем? Все уже написано до меня. Кто знает - тот знает. Кто не знает - советую взять и попробовать, оно того стоит",1,1,0,8,0,2016-09-16,2016-09-16,0,115,29,29

Огромное удовольствие доставляет великое множество вариантов прохождения, проходил игру без единого выстрела, проходил смахивая все на своем пути. Маг это сильно, но техник гораздо веселей.
Интересный факт долгое время не мог начать линейку поклонения богам, так как играл закоренелым техником, а статуетка для дара эльфийскому богу продается у мага. Узнал где ее найти только через год игры)

"A good rpg... That hasn't aged well, oh dear!

Its quite in-depth and loosely Fallout-esque, I used to spend hours on this one.  Its never really had a great big following and I was disappointed it took too long to appear on Steam.  I wouldn't call it ""fun"" more like ""really interesting"". If you preferred older pre-Skyrhim RPGs were everything was more DnD traditional style and less ""OMG here is something that shoots boom!"", then you'll like this more.  If you prefer the modern OTT fantasy style, you might not like this. 

I prefer to play as a high Chrisma and high intelligence character.  Though playing as a dim-witted half-ogre whose dialogue amounts to ""he died, him silly!"" then it can be funny.  Especially when Gillbert Bates yells about shiny coins at you.  Though I only recommend playing this as an idiot once... The game is harder despite the humour and you get less gold.

Then we get to the ""tech versus magic"" thing.  Tech stuff is easy to get hold of and doesn't tend to drain your blue bar (forget as I write this what the blue bar means).  While magic is powerful but you have to work it a lot.  Technology is better at fighting magic, but magic has a lot more applications.  In the end you have to make some real choices.

The game used to also wipe out your intelligence points when you got to the panarii (spelling) main building, which was annoying and there was a way around this... Can't remember it.  But you suddenly became stupid.  I do not know if this is the fixed version, haven't got that far.  Also, a tip for people who want to break into higher levels beond the game allowence; level XP requirements are stored on a certain game related document, edit it and you can change when you level and how man times you level.  Its pretty simple cheating there... 

I did like the fat one of the patches pre-steam release did allow followers to level up as they only originally did so when you did. That meant when you hit max, they stopped leveling.  So the devs cared a little about the bugs in-game during its day.   

As for followers... As I said I like to have high chrisma which means I get max.  You need a healer with a large party and a few options exist.  Virgil is one, but he isn't the best at first, though I'd give a spoiler, he can become better later.  You also need a heavy hitter, arly game you can convince the ""worlds smartest"" orc to join you.  He and Magnus fill the roles between them, the ""orc"" better.  Later on you'll get even better followers...

Overall, the only thing I miss was the OTT manual that cam with the game... Plus you don't really see the loading screens anymore.

Also, have more then 1 save game file; the game can at times corrupt its save files, don't ask how or why it just does. 

Also, as with the levels a certain file can easily be edited to write your own backgrounds.  Though no maxing out states, the devs managed to cap things there somehow. Actuually, this game is pretty easy to edit details if you know which word file to alter.",1,0,0,3,0,2016-09-16,2016-09-16,1068,169,242,120

"One of the best RPG's I've ever played. I still have my physical copy from way back when, though as soon as I saw this on steam (and especially at such a cheap price!) I instantly picked it up. I'm not sure I've replayed any RPG as much as I have this one. While it's true it has its shortcomings, I think its positives more than make up for them. I dont think I've seen many or any other game(s) with such an immersive and well-designed world/environment. 

Pros:

-Large variety in play-style/character customization, with tons of different specializations available.

-Most major quests have several different ways of being solved (and many of them are quite hard to find, particularly as a rogue-type character). Some might consider this a con, as many times you'll only realize those alternate paths existed long after you decided that certain (more obvious) approaches were the only ways.

-Many unique quests and possibilities depending on the skills you choose and how much you've levelled them, or the choices you make along your path and the people you talk to.

-Fairly large amount of freedom from the beginning, though I believe some parts are relatively linear.

-A very well designed world and environment, with a great deal of immersion.

Cons:

The combat isn't the best, for sure. It feels like the beginning is pretty rough unless you roll a warrior or certain magic schools (though you can almost always talk or sneak your way through situations, or with some lucky/save scummy use of items), and there are certain ""linear progression points"" that suddenly and drastically increase in difficulty. This has almost always led me to grind out levels to the point where I had most of the core skills I wanted and some pretty hefty combat skills, and even then you can still get utterly rocked. I honestly can't agree with such a design, but oh well. Maybe you're just meant to explore everything as soon as possible in order to gain those levels and better gear, I dont know. 
That being said, it doesnt necessarilly mean the combat is absolutely terrible, just some (imo) poor decisions on design and progression. 

-It didn't happen often, but there were some bugs that could wind up with you walking through a wall, and forcing you to reload/teleport (assuming you actually had the ability to teleport)


All in all, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a good ""open world"" RPG. This was the game that got me into the fallout series, and I still don't think any of them came close to comparing. I gladly would have paid 3x the price for this even though I still have the cd's, just to have it on steam.",1,1,0,13,1,2016-09-09,2016-09-09,484,15,45,23
"The narrator calls Arcanum a place of possibility. A place of change. The possibilities are indeed endless in this place, and change is inevitable. How and when said change will occur, however, is completely up to you- the only survivor of the IFS Zephyr crash.

The character system may be overwhelming at first, but it's straighforward enough to build an efficient character, both from a power play and roleplaying perspective. You can be dumb or smart, good or evil, fighter or ranger, charming or repulsive, gambler or trader, spellcaster or technologist, and their combinations. Even the most trivial side quest can have numerous solutions and outcomes depending on your character build and your choices. I especially recommend a persuasion master, and an unintelligent character (IN<5) for their unique dialogue lines.

The only major flaw I can think of is the combat system, which consists of picking your ""attack"", be it melee, a damage dealing spell, or a ranged weapon, and your target. You don't have to worry about positioning, line of sight, or enemies which require a different approach. Perhaps some tactical depth and higher difficulty could make Arcanum the absolute best isometric RPG. You won't care about light penalties or range penalties after a certain point, and combat will become a chore.

It's still amazing at everything else I can think of, and it totally deserves its praise.",1,1,0,9,1,2016-09-08,2016-09-20,374,41,27302,3979

2) The plot is also interesting. Large side quests and party stories. 
3) Role Play matters. Persuasion is hard, the dialogs are well-written. Evil and good paths do differ.
4) Relatevely large locations (for 2001).
5) Great actors (however, few persons have actor voices).
6) Legendary music by Ben Houge.

"This is the best game ever. 

Made by Troika Games, authors of Fallout and another bugged, unbalanced, yet cult game Vampire: Bloodlines.

Arcanum has horrible graphics. It has horrible combat. And its 'balance' is nonexistant. You can literally walk through the entire game by using ONLY one spell. The one you can start with.

Yet still Arcanum is the best game ever. It has one of the most captivating settings. It's a wonderful world, a merger of steampunk science and magic. It has lots of characters and story choices, most of them hidden and not given out in the open like in most modern RPGs. Of course sometimes even in Arcanum you have an option 'you either go here, or go there' but there is always a third way. And a fourth. And in most cases a fifth and a sixth.

Almost all quests in Arcanum have 4 or even more ways to finish them (and several to fail). This brings enormous replayability, and even after years you can find out that some quest could've been completed differently.

Arcanum is offering all of it. The moral dilemma, the ambiguity of your choices, the vastness of the world. If you can tolerate the graphics, clunky combat system and the fact that all skill choices are unbalanced, you're in for a treat. Dumb Half-Ogre? Halfling-thief? Intelligent Half-Orc? Elf-Engineer? Selfless or selfish, savior or villain, or anything inbetween. Possibilities of real roleplay are endless here.

This is and will stay my only review for a game on steam. Just because this one is the one I deeply care about.

"[h1] Review - Arcanum of Steamworks and Magick Obscura [/h1]

===

[h1] Rating: 9.0 / 10 - Outstanding Masterpiece of Role-Playing [/h1]

===

[h1] Pros & Cons [/h1]

[b] + Pros + [/b]

+ Deep, meaningful and varied character creation that importantly modifies role-playing experience

+ Immense character development, with loads of spells to learn, blueprints to craft and skills to master

+ Incredibly well-made role-playing interaction between player and NPCs, rivaled only by very few other 
legendary RPGs

+ Huge world to explore, with many secret locations to discover and random encounters

+ Possibility to choose between Real-time or Turn based combat, and switch between them at any time

+ More items to collect, loot, create, salvage and steal than you can ever imagine

+ Incredible variety of enemies, each place you visit will have its own unique ones mostly, rarely you will ever see a recycled model or enemy ever

+ Companions will react to player actions by discussing them, maybe approving them, or leaving the party if excessivley offended, or even try to stop him based on their alignment, character type and situation

+ Excellent AI of NPCs makes stealing, pickpocketing, murdering and generally bad actions much difficult to perform, you will have to find good strategies

+ Very deep and complex main quest that will surely entertain new and veteran players alike

+ Very varied secondary quests, forget all the repetitive stuff you see nowadays iN RPGs, this is the stuff of old and legend, this is the real deal

+ Drastic level of difficulty (played on Hard mode) ensures constant challenge even for experienced RPG players

+ Beautiful setting and lore, expanded by many documents you can read and stories you can hear about the world


[b] - Cons - [/b]

- Combat system is clunky and quite messy: companion AI cannot be configured, and they cannot be controlled in any way, this resulting in many combat failures and gruesome deaths for the player

- Game itself needs lots of unofficial patches and commands to be fixed and run properly on modern systems

- Biggest issue in my opinion: World exploration is boring: exploring the world is done via a 2D geographical map, the player represented by a red dot. You have the possibility to plot a course and explore the world, but locations are very sparse and many do not have any indication of their wereabouts. This results in you, looking at a moving dot for hours, just to find a random dungeon on the world map. Also, a location is detected only if the player goes really close to it on the map, and the map is HUGE, so yeah, it's very boring after some hours.

- No fast travel, regularly. You may either take the train or be a powerful mage and use the teleport which IS fast travel. This wouldn't be a bad thing if not for the really ugly exploration part of the game as i said above.

- Cannot Alt-Tab the game properly: it still stays on screen, forcing players to close it if they need to do something else on the desktop, if they do not have multi-monitor setup

"I played and replayed different characters constently in this game as a child. Revisiting this game now, years later, I realize now that what I was really attracted to was the setting, and the reason I kept restarting was because the gameplay didn't support the story. 

The world is brilliantly devised and executed, with wonderful art and music that really enhance the sense of playing in an alternate reality late-19th century infused with magic. Playing for a few minutes, I recall what held it back. Although the storytelling and game choices encourage you role play a number of really interesting roles, from tinkerer to illusionist to socialite and more, the game *mechanics* highly reward brute-force methods, rewarding *hits* on the enemy and offering very clunky combat options. Berserkers and Death Mages will have fun steamrolling this game, watching the story go by largely inconsequentially, while pickpockets and sharpshooters will struggle to progress, wondering why they spend so much time gathering resources that will do very little to open up interesting storylines or progress past combat obstacles the devolve into tit-for-tat hits.

Disappointing that such a richly developed world was stuck with such poor combat mechanics, the central gameplay element outside of the story.

"A review I wrote back in 2001:

The last division of Dragon Knights has arrived. Thousands of men in shiny armour, mounted on the best horses Arcanum has ever seen, the pride of Cumbria, are waiting for their commander to issue the melee command. They are about to fight the battle of all battles and show the Tarantian technologists why steel and magick are superior over gunpowder and machines! Nothing can compare with bravery of Dragon Knights and might of their swords. The atmosphere is tense; everyone is waiting for that final command. “Melee!” – Screamed Obsidur as the river of knights started to flow down the hill. Capturing the land, meter by meter, the knights were amazed by the reaction of Tarantian soldiers. They didn’t move one bit! They were waiting… This just didn’t seem right, and fear strengthened among the Cumbrians. They never fought against guns, but their leaders can’t be wrong – the guns must be weak! They just must!

They were wrong. As knights closed in, Tarantian riflemen fired hundreds of bullets while huge machines nullified Cumbrian wizards at the back. What a massacre! Cumbria lost its complete army. Glorious Dragon Knights are no more and Tarant is about to become Aracnum’s most powerful nation. The age of technology is ahead…

Okay, I may not be the best writer in the world, but I just had to show you how magick (note, it’s magic with k at the end) and tech both exist in the same time in Arcanum. The best way to describe it actually is to say that it’s a real nice, well-balanced mixture of Baldur’s Gate and Fallout. Arcanum is populated by Tolkienesque characters that include humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, orcs and ogres (plus half elves, half ogres and half orcs), but as the game was made by the team responsible for Fallout, it leans toward avantgarde and introduces the industrial revolution to the world of magic!

You start the game as a sole survivor of a zeppelin crash. Actually, there was one more survivor who, just before he died, gave you some mystic ring and asked you to “deliver it to the boy as he’ll know what to do with it”. From this moment on, you will be under attack of many assassins and involve yourself into a huge story that will have more twists than you could ever imagine.

First of all you need to create your character. You can actually pick one of the offered, pre-made chars but what fun is that? You will be able to choose any of the usual RPG races such as human, elf, dwarf, half-orc, half-ogre, the gender and other usual stuff. The “unusual” options are those that take care of your “alignment“. There are three tabs that list various skills, tech knowledge and magick abilities. There are almost hundred things in you can specialize so I suggest you to pick one or maybe two things and try to become an expert in that. But we’ll talk about that later. At the end of character creation, you will be able to pick one of the offered character backgrounds. There are about 50 of those and they directly affect you in many ways. For example, you can pick “raised by orcs” background that will make you very strong, but less appealing and of low intelligence. On the other hand you can pick to be “born under a sign” and cause less critical hits and misses, but whenever they occur – they will be spectacular (I managed to cut off my leg by one critical miss!).

I can tell you, the character sheet of this game is the most detailed piece of information I have ever seen in any game! Each time you advance a level, you will be given an extra point to distribute into any skill or characteristic you want (unless a skill is influenced by a characteristic; such as: level 4 alchemist requires intelligence of 14 or so). The best thing to do is to carefuly decide what you want to be at the beginning. There are about 30 “professions” to chose from and if you tend to be a little bit of everything, you will have a hard time going through the game. To give you a sight into what you can be I will list you a few professions: thief, alchemist, herbalist, inventor, bomber, gunman, water mage, fire mage, illusionist, swordfighter, knife thrower… Intriguing? No, fascinating!

As you travel through the land of Steamworks and Magick, you will encounter thousands of NPCs, dozens of cities, ruins, dungeons, ancient graves, temples, altars… You will also meet people who might join you in your quest and be valuable companions throughout the game. One such person is Virgil who will meet you at the very start. He’s a healer wizard that can become a skilled fighter and will probably stay with you ‘til the very end (plus, he’s a very interesting person and will… nah, I can’t tell you! I don’t want to give out a spoiler!). Unlike in Baldur’s Gate, you can’t control other characters as you might wish to, but it’s still better than Fallout as you can issue commands and trade with them easily.
Arcanum offers literally hundreds of quests. Most of them are optional, of course, and if you tend to complete as much as possible, I can guarantee you to have at least 80 hours of active game play. Pretty much, wouldn’t you say? What’s even better is the fact that with all those possible professions, you will be unable to accept certain quests, as you will not be able to complete them. You simply cannot go through a LOT of Thieves Guild quests unless you have a high lockpicking and pick pocketing skill; if your persuasion is low, you will have to use force a lot and that might not be the best solution and so on. And for all of us who hate the FedEx quests (go somewhere, fetch an item and bring it back) – good news! There are only a few such missions, and even they include a lot of bashing.

There are a lot of innovations concerning the items as well. Aside from the usual “normal” and magical items, Arcanum offers a variety of tech items. Mechanized axe or gauntlets for example. There are also a lot of guns, ranging from flintlock pistols and revolvers to shotguns and automatic weapons. Heck, you can even find schematics throughout the world, learn them and make new items by combining various items! By using those schematics, you can create such things as Molotov cocktails, spike guns or even the incredible automatons and arachnids (spider-like fighting robots!).

Overall, this game is definitely the best thing that has happened since the last Baldur’s Gate. Great gameplay, incredible character detail, superb story and great possibilities make Arcanum a fantastic game.",1,0,0,50,2,2016-09-04,2016-09-04,2785,77,13,13

"Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura wurde von Troika Games entwickelt und im August 2001 von Sierra On-Line veröffentlicht. Der deutsche Titel lautet Arcanum: Von Dampfmaschinen und Magie. Das Spiel ist, und das ist nicht nur meine Meinung eines der besten RPGs aller Zeiten. Leider soff Troika ab bevor das Spiel völlig durchgepatched war und war damit schon heftig buggig. Ich bin noch am rätseln ob die Steam-Version die meisten offiziellen Patches enthält wie die GoG-Version. Es gibt gibt jedenfalls eine Reihe von sog. Communitypatches.

I played this one years ago and was happy to play it with my friends. But one day my PC crashed horribly and fried the CD :( 

This game makes a whole lot of fun, its graphics are nothing for a spoiled kiddo that just plays ""teh best graphicz gamez"" but its storyline, way of playing is a gem for every RPG player! 

You can choose between two major paths, technology or magic. If you choose technology and progress further and further in it magic will have less and less of an impact on you. Meaning also positive spells like revive or healing. If you progress further into magic you can use some technology items, but you can hurl powerful spells at the enemies (dont worry, as far as i can remember even robots get blown to pieces by you spells, the technology affinity is just implemented for players i guess). If you want to you can also play a hybrid to combine the best of both ways, but you better know what you do.

Sadly the mutliplayer has just one real map as far as i know and if you finished it once you know the tricks and can finish it again. But before you finish it is a major adventure where you need high pathfinding skills for one area.

"Let's get this out of the way - Arcanum has horrible, horrible dungeons, combat sucks, the end game is a rushed boring crap and there's a bunch of bugs (so use the fan-patches).

Yet, it's one of my favorite RPGs - voted by the RPG Codex the #5 best RPG of all-time.

How so? Because it excels at everything else. 

The world is amazing, a clash of medieval fantasy with the industrial revolution. More than just a nice background, it's used to offer an intriguing magic/technology duality and raise complex questions like ""should orcs receive equal pay to humans at factories?""

The classless character system is highly detailed and with several races, backgrounds, spells, skills, crafting recipes and technological schematics. You can play anything from a charismatic elven enchantress who relies on its 5 followers to a spiteful dwarf inventor, adventuring alone with his trusty flamethrower.

Moreover, the world will react to your choices. Expect to suffer racism if you play as orc or half-ogre, to be expelled from trains if you play a mage (who cares, you can teleport!), to be banned from men's clubs if you play a women, etc...

Quests are amazing. To hell with the ""kill 5/5 X"" MMO-ish garbage push out today, Arcanum has you investigating murders and rumors, debating economics and politics, dealing with prejudice and racism, etc. And they often have multiple solutions. Need to solve a murder? If you're a necromancer, why not raise the victim's spirit and ask him directly? FINALLY A GAME THAT UNDERSTANDS MAGIC!

Then there's the beautiful soundtrack, the gorgeous grid-based inventory with detailed artwork & item descriptions, the clever plot twists, the countless role-plying opportunities, the reactive companions, Tarant - the best city in any RPG... hell, this is a game where you can complete a quest and read about it the next day on the city's newspapers! 

Arcanum is easily one of the most ambitious games ever made. Building upon what Fallout 1 & 2 did, it showed players just how rich, reactive and interesting an RPG could really be. 

It has many failings, but no other game ever came close to its successes.",1,0,0,338,9,2016-08-31,2016-08-31,1497,92,149,145

"ееееее! Арканум вернулся!

лучшая, на мой взгляд, RPG. странно, конечно, что разрабы не догадались впихнуть в него поддержку нормальных разрешений, но для этого уже давно существуют патчи, так что без разницы.

честно говоря, даже спустя 15 лет я бы купил его и за большие деньги, чем две сотни. это эталон, в некотором роде, единственный и неповторимый. впрочем, этот факт не мешает все еще надеяться на шикарное продолжение.

всем любителям толковых RPG однозначно рекомендую - игра шикарна во всех проявлениях. она настолько атмосферна и уютна, что, едва ее запустив, почувствовал, будто сижу у камина и раскуриваю трубку, беседуя о приключениях с Франклином Пейном для нового номера ""Тарантианца"" и разглядывая его легендарное крупнокалиберное ружье.",1,1,0,39,0,2016-08-30,2016-08-30,0,31,239,236
"I can not recommend this game enough.
I only have so few hours of game time since i already own it from before, and have played it from start to finish more than 10 times.

Like many older games, the age of arcanum is starting to get apparent, but as soon as you get into it, it is a fantastic game, with sidequests that are better than the whole MQ from fallout 4.

Starting out as an amnesiac after a crash in an airship, the story kicks off with you just trying to get your bearings in the world, and your role in it. 

The steampunk theme of the game is in my opinion still unsurpassed in both scope and quality, with a really cool clash between magic and industry built into both story and game mechanic.

I don't want to spoil anything of the game for you, should you choose to buy it, but if you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, Fallout 1 & 2, or Neverwinter Nights, this game will be right up your alley.

The half turn based half real time, press space to pause combat system takes a while to get used to, and like i said before, the game is showing it's age. But if you feel like a slightly clunky combat system never got in the way of you enjoying a masterpiece of an RPG before, get Arcanum.

"I finished Arcanum for at least 4 times. Everytime I did though, it was a different experience. This game gives you so much room for roleplaying that it makes your tabletop games look like hack'n slashes. From a herbalist healer, to a psychopath, from a witty magical thief to a brute who can't even properly speak. Literally, anything that comes to your mind.

You can finish this game by killing everyone, or you can finish it without even raising your fists.
Everything is up to how you want your character to interact with the rich world around them. 

A lot of quests have more than one solution, and by more than one I don't mean some shallow choices like ""pickpocket or kill"". There are real moral choices in even the simplest quests. 

Arcanum is not only about what you do, but how you do and why you do. The interaction with the other characters is so deep just visiting a tavern and mingling with other people can be a tremendous experience.

Being ugly, being mentally challenged, being vicious, being polite, being sickly, being misanthropic, being seductive... everything is a unique experience in this game. Don't afraid of being experimental in creating your character, be an ugly but charismatic negotiator, be a short tempered gambling addict who kills people when he loses, be a mad scientist who experiments his new electric gun on village folk because hey, who cares about a small village when we are talking about scientific progression? Whatever you be, the game finds a way to acknowledge and reward you for your roleplay.

Интересные диалоги, нестандартные квесты, хорошо проработанные напарники и NPC, красивый и захватывающий мир магии и технологии все это в совокупности делают из Arcanum одной из лучших, а на мой взгляд так и самую лучшую игру в жанре RPG.",1,1,0,22,2,2016-08-30,2016-08-30,0,4,424,300

Arcanum is one of the best CRPGs I have ever played. The world and story are deep and expansive with characters that have real personalities. The game is steeped in complex choices for your character with a high degree of reactivity to what you do. There is almost always multiple ways through any given situation and straight forward violence is rarely your only option. The way you design your character has a large effect on the game you experience and as such makes for great replayability. The soundtrack is beautiful and moving and the voice-acting is quality. Overall the game is an experience worth having and for the current price will be a great return on investment. 10/10 would buy again :P,1,1,0,26,0,2016-08-30,2016-08-30,0,1,8,8

"This is probably my favorite game, one which I have played throughout most of my life.

Imagine if a fantasy world inspired by LotR or D&D hit the industrial age.

Arcanum is an open world, open ended RPG with either turn based or real time combat (can be changed at will).
Magic and technology are two opposite sides of the same coin, and you can choose one or the other, or may walk the middle ground.
The game often offers many ways of tackling a quest. For example:
[spoiler]In one of the first quests, some bandits require a toll be paid if you wish to pass a bridge. You can pay this toll, you can convince them you're a bandit yourself, you can work with them, you can steal the key, or you can kill them.[/spoiler]

Another thing I like about this, which you don't see in some modern games like Skyrim (still love that game though) is that you can fail quests, and can pretty much kill anyone. Sometimes this results in failing that quest.

You've got a variety of spells and technology to choose from. You can raise the spirits of the recent dead to speak with them at and early level, or at a high level can even resurrect the dead. Your companions can die, but if you have the spell, resurrection scroll, you can bring them back.

As a technologist you can craft guns, tech armor, automatons, and more. As you progress through the tech field, you get schematics for crafting your stuff. Alternatively, you can also find schematics out in the world to craft things you wouldn't get from just leveling up.

There are also other skills your character can utilize, such as bartering, gambling, persuasion, and pickpocket. If you have the relevant stat (strength, dexterity, etc), you can train its respective skill. If you get that skill to the maximum level, you're not done yet. You have to train with the masters of that skill to gain the most benefit from it. The final Master level of each skill has a quest which you must complete to be considered the master.

You can also steal most things, if you have the relevant skill. Sneak in to a shop, and you can steal all of their wares.

The game has some bugs. I recommend installing the official and unofficial patches, and the high resolution patch. http://www.terra-arcanum.com/downloads/

There are some things I wish the game did better, like shopkeepers won't shoo you out of their shop before they head to bed, which makes it a bit easy to steal their stuff. I still love the game though.

Tip: F1-F6 give quick commands to your companions. F7 quicksaves, F8 quickloads.",1,1,0,82,2,2016-08-29,2016-08-29,0,56,62,62
"This is the best RPG ever made.  I spent hundreds of hours on this game back in the day.

Prepare for a world where magic and technology are at war with a deep and satisfying lore throughout.

This game offers unmatched choice for how to create your characters and how to interact with the world.  The game is a completely different experience with different types of characters.  You can make a stupid, beefy fighter, and you will walk right past most of the policitical intrique (of course, you are too stupid to pick up on it).  Make a beautiful socialite with no combat skills, but charm the biggest thugs into doing your bidding for you and talk your way through very in depth dialogue trees.  Fancy yourself an intelligent caster?  Or maybe a thief with a heart of gold?  A technomancer with a knack for gadgets?  All this and more can be done!

Even the starting quests and starting towns are well written with multiple approaches and multiple solutions depending on the choices you make and your playstyle.  Want to wipe out an entire town?  You can do it, and the other towns will know about it!  Or maybe you just want to enslave them all with your charm and good looks?  Or maybe....

The game still has some bugs, and the multiplayer was never quite as satisfying as I would have hope, but the single player experience is second to none to this day.  This game is for people that want to ROLEPLAY, not have all of their choices pre-determined.

Highly recommended.  Buy this game right now!

"Whilst I haven't put any hours into the steam version of this game, I have owned and played Arcanum many times over the years. 
By far one of my favourite RPGs of all time. I highly recommend it to anybody who is a fan of the original Fallout games or Baldurs Gate. With a really impressive story and lengthy game time it is absolutely worth the $6 being asked for it. I'm not even going to explain the particulars. Just buy it. And play it.

If your not a fan of older style RPGs with rich character development and complex storytelling, then stay away. If your not a fan of Magik or Tech, or in particular, BOTH put together, then stay away. 
If you have $6 to blow, then buy the game regardless. It will not disapoint.",1,1,0,22,0,2016-08-29,2016-08-29,0,1,121,27

"Лучшая игра ever. Наконец-то дождалась, очень много бессонных ночей было проведено в Аркануме. Крутейший саундтрек, миллион возможных веток развития событий, хорошо прописанные герои, открытый мир ну и естественно стимпанк. Очень жаль что нет мультиплея и врядли дождемся вторую часть (привет, firefly), но несмотря на эти мелочи 10\10",1,1,0,47,0,2016-08-29,2016-08-29,0,1,18,18
"""Arcanum : Engrenages et Sortilèges"" est un ambitieux jeu de rôles à l'ambiance particulière et d'une profondeur peu commune sorti en 2001 par Troika Games.

Vous y faites évoluer un héros en devenir dans un monde en pleine révolution industrielle et dont les croyances en la magie ancestrale peinent à y survivre, thème qui sera constamment au coeur du soft : MAGIE vs. TECHNOLOGIE.

Votre rôle ? Courir après le fantôme d'un Dieu païen dont vous seriez la réincarnation selon une prophétie millénaire...

Cette aventure non-linéaire vous entraînera bien malgré vous dans nombre d'endroits improbables, afin d'appréhender davantage ce milieu si unique. Au travers de la quête principale et de plus d'une centaine de quêtes annexes, vous visiterez de nombreuses villes aux cultures toutes très différentes ainsi que 76 lieux à découvrir au hasard de vos pérégrinations sur la carte.

Le système de jeu est à l'image du scénario et des quêtes, c'est-à-dire ouvert. Les compétences, les aptitudes, l'orientation techno/mago que l'on donne à son personnage : tout cela offre une customisation extrême de son avatar, ce qui a un réel impact sur la façon de le jouer et les possibilités qui s'offrent aux joueurs (comme tordre le cou aux quelques poncifs de l'univers fantasy, avec un nain lanceur de sorts ou un elfe féru d'armes à feu).

Que vous choisissiez d'incarner un mage maîtrisant les quelques 80 sorts issus des 16 écoles de magie différentes, ou un technologiste touchant aux 56 inventions tirées des 8 disciplines proposées, vous aurez toujours quelque chose à apprendre ou à créer !

Ajoutez à cela le choix du sexe, de la race (présentes au nombre de neuf) et de l'ingénieuse notion d'antécédent - sorte d'historique qui joue sur vos statistiques de départ et vos interactions futures avec le monde et les PNJ : ""élevé par des loups"", ""pyromane"", ""enfant de héros"", ""lunatique en liberté"", ""agoraphobe"", etc...

Sans parler de votre alignement (bon ou mauvais) influencé par vos actions qui déterminera les compagnons que vous pourrez recruter parmi les 25 disponibles - si toutefois vous parvenez à les trouver - et vous comprendrez que vous ne jouerez probablement jamais deux fois une même partie !

Malgré son âge déjà respectable et une interface graphique désormais un peu désuète, l'immersion reste toujours aussi forte de par sa réalisation esthétique, sa bande originale mélancolique à souhait (à déconseiller aux dépressifs cependant) et surtout son univers steampunk original...

Univers dans lequel le joueur n'est pas figé dans une trame scénaristique pré-mâchée, où l'on a le droit d'être inventif et peut résoudre parfois les problèmes de quatre ou cinq façons différentes - la violence n'offrant que rarement les meilleures récompenses.

Maintenant que vous devez être bien appâtés après avoir lu jusqu'ici, voici enfin la ""cerise sur le gâteau"" afin d'achever de vous convaincre sur le potentiel inouï de ce jeu : le combat final contre le Big Boss peut être évité au moyen d'une conversation avec ce dernier, aux répliques mûrement réfléchies - pour peu que vous soyez alors passé maître dans l'art de la persuasion.

Non non ce n'est pas une blague, vous pouvez VRAIMENT amener le grand méchant du jeu à reconsidérer ses actes, au point de lui faire perdre toute volonté de se battre et ce juste avant la fin ! Une première en la matière si je ne m'abuse, qui m'avait fait un effet boeuf à l'époque où je l'ai découvert...

Pour finir, je recommande à tous ceux appréciant les CRPG complexes et profonds de tenter cette aventure car que l'on aime ce jeu ou pas... l'expérience ne laisse en tous les cas jamais indifférent :)

"Best rpg of all times. Buggy, but the quests, the world, the lore and the themes make up for it plenty. 11/10",1,1,0,79,3,2016-08-29,2016-08-29,733,38,635,555
"Arcanum of Steamworks and Magick Obscura is a very underrated and forgotten crpg. It was the first game created by Troika games, which was founded by several of the developers of the original Fallout.

Arcanum takes place in a Victorian era fantasy world. And has all of the staples of typical medieval fantasy elements. There's magic, dwarves, elves, gnomes, orcs and so forth. But they've all been adapted into a more modern world. Now there are firearms, steam power, zeppelins, and so forth. Intermixed with orcs that wear tailcoats and wield gattling guns.

The game plays very similarly to the original Fallout. But it allows you to select between turn based and real time, with turn based being the obvious better option. Arcanum was ahead of its time in a lot of respects. For starters it is a true open world game, allowing you to walk from the very start of the game all the way to the other end of the continent uninterrupted. It was also to my knowledge the very first game to feature preorder DLC, if you preordered the game you recieved an extra dungeon on a CD. The soundtrack is all classical music and still remains one of my favorite OSTs. 

It's a fantasy version of Fallout set in a steampunk world. It's everything you've ever wanted in an rpg, released 15 years ago. Go figure.

This version appears to be the CD version of the game. It appears to work with Arcanum's widescreen mod so it's really a toss up if you wanna spring for the GOG version or the Steam version at this rate.

"Одна из первых моих игр в жизни. Отличный сюжет, восхитительный мир. Лучшая.",1,1,0,49,4,2016-08-29,2016-08-30,0,2,50,19
"Зачем писать обзор на игру, которая уже десяток+ лет, как легендарная, культовая, имеет кучу фан-патчей, модов, форумов, фан-сообществ (""Arcanum Club"", ""Arcane Coast"" и т.д.), любители до сих пор что-то разрабатывают (фанатские Arcanum Multiverse Edition, Sir's Expectations Modpack, Arcanum: Legacy of Vendigroth и т.д. и т.п.), а при том игре уже, между прочим, без малого 15 лет?! Поэтому...

...просто скажу, что это моя самая любимая игра в жизни; и есть лишь три игры, способные посостязаться с ней в моём личном топе, а именно: Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment и Baldur's Gate. Но  на мой взгляд, именно Arcanum является самой лучшей, а главное самобытной, РПГ всех времен, вплоть и до ненышнего дня. Ни в одну так часто не переигрывала: в детстве/юности проходила сама раз 26, + заваливалась к друзьям, чтобы проходить ещё и с ними вместе (тогда, до интернетов, было принято ходить к друзьям со двора ""в гости""  на целые геймерские посиделки часов на 6-8 - то, что сейчас называется ""стримхатами""), потом ещё и будучи студенткой перепроходила - короче, каждый год стабильно хотелось перепройти игру ""от"" и ""до"", попитаться этой атмосферой. В угаре по этому воплощению искусства я заходила настолько далеко, что с появлением всяких ютубов ещё и пересматривала все лестплеи по ней на других языках, чтобы увидеть, как игра на них смотрится, её юморок и прочее - не надоедало смотреть в тысячной раз то, что сама и так знала наизусть, даже из-за виртуального плеча ноунеймового иноязычного лестплейщика.

Думаю, такая характеристика для данного шедевра будет гораздо красноречивее банального расписывания фактов, свойств, особенностей геймплея, механики и прочего. Я бы так и поступила с обзором на любую более-менее современную игру, ибо обзор должен быть обзором, а не ором со слезами счастья и потрошением всего багажа воспоминаний и чувств ностальгии автора; но описывать детально игру, заслуги которой итак известны абсолютно всем ценителям жанра рпг в целом - смысла мало. Расценивать ""обзор"" стоит лишь со стороны просто ещё одного ""пальчика вверх"" в копилку восторженных отзывов Стима.

P.S. Игра только сегодня поступила в продажу в Стим, благодаря тому, что, по всей видимости, тяжбы между издателями разрешились; но за всю жизнь до появления игры здесь мной в неё было наиграно около 2500-3000 часов точно. Жаль, что в Стиме весь отчёт идёт с нуля. Теперь издатель Активижн, и, как бы я ни ненавидела Активижн,  Сиерры (прежнего издателя) уже давно не существует. А обойти стороной столь желанное появление предмета бессонных ночей доброй половины моей жизни я не могу, посему мои жалкие 209 рублей отправляются зашкварным Активиженам. Зато приятно удивляет цена, учитывая имя издателя. Ввиду всего в последнем абзаце - стоит ли тешить хоть малюсенькую надежду на появление Planescape'а в Стиме, а также на возвращение первого и второго NWN, которые , к слову, года три назад в Стиме были в виде Diamond Edition - NWN 1 и Platinum Edition  - NWN 2 ?

P.P.S. Данный абзац содержит небольшие примеры того, на что способна игра, если не хотите что-то узнать заранее, лучше не читайте текущий абзац дальше, хотя вряд ли хоть кто-то мог этого не знать из любителей жанра. Впрочем, он не содержит ни слова о сюжете или каких-либо алертных твистах, так что... В какой ещё игре есть город по размерам столь большой, что выучить его не проще, чем научиться ориентироваться в , к примеру, Туле. Город, в борделе которого мадам Лил по запросу на ""что-нибудь нетривиальное"" предложит вам... овечку Белль. Город, в музее рас и народностей которого есть экспонат-орк, который на самом деле является человеком, хитро обманывающим посетителей, и который на самом деле страстно обожает чай, если раскусить и раскрутить его на беседу при прохождение должных чеков в диалоге. Город, в котором есть поезд, на который не пускают магов и собаку - да-да, неспроста два этих существительных стоят рядом. Город, в котором есть элитный клуб [s]куртуазных маньеристов[/s] джентльменов. В какой ещё игре при отыгрывании тупого персонажа с низким Интеллектом в игре под данный билд будут изменены не только ВСЕ диалоги аля Фоллаут 2 (причем в крайне хохотливую форму), но и даже записки в меню вашего журнала квестов на манер ""я литеть в дерижбамбеле он розбица а какой-то карлан дал мне блестюку на палец и сразу умир гыыы"" дескать, если отыгрывать тупого перса, то и заметки в журнал он писал бы на уровне владения языком зрителя вашего ненавистного ютубера/блогера/стримера. Уникальная игра... Эх..
